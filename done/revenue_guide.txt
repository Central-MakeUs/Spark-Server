혜택을 선택할 때는 해당 혜택을 제공하는 데 비용과 시간이 얼마나 드는지 고려해야 합니다. 혜택 마련에 드는 노력과 시간을 효과적으로 관리하기 위한 계획을 마련하세요.
시작 단계
공지 동영상을 업로드하여 커뮤니티에 멤버십 혜택의 가치를 알립니다. 멤버십이 무엇인지, 멤버십을 시작하는 이유는 무엇인지, 회원에게는 어떤 혜택이 제공되는지 잘 전달해야 합니다.
관심 있는 시청자를 멤버로 전환하기 위해, 가입 버튼을 클릭하는 시청자를 위한 소개 동영상을 업로드합니다. 이 동영상을 사용하여 회원이 되면 기대할 수 있는 사항과 혜택을 빠르게 설명하세요.

멤버십 탭에 게시물을 업로드하여 신규 회원과 소통합니다.
YouTube 스튜디오를 사용하여 어떤 등급에 회원이 가장 많은지, 회원 확보 및 유지 데이터는 어떤지 모니터링하세요.
권장사항
동기 알리기: 멤버십 프로그램을 시작하는 이유와 달성하고자 하는 목표에 관해 설명하세요. 크리에이터의 열정과 동기를 보여주면 시청자가 크리에이터를 응원할 가능성이 높아집니다.
안심시키기: 회원이 되지 않더라도 바뀌는 것은 없다는 사실을 시청자에게 인지시켜 주세요. 멤버십 프로그램을 충성도가 높은 시청자에게 제공되는 부가 가치로 제시하고, 일반 시청자가 멤버십에 가입하지 않는다고 해서 무언가를 '놓치는' 것은 아니라는 점을 알려주세요.
투명하게 공개하기: 회원이 지불한 금액이 어떻게 사용될 예정인지 설명할 수도 있습니다. 이렇게 하면 신뢰를 구축할 수 있으며, 장기적인 관점에서 크리에이터를 후원해야 하는 이유를 제시할 수 있습니다.
일관된 홍보: 채널 멤버십 혜택을 지속적으로 홍보하는 것을 잊지 마세요. 동영상에서 멤버십을 정기적으로 언급하는 크리에이터는 그렇지 않은 크리에이터보다 대개 2배 더 많은 회원을 유치합니다.
채널 멤버십 혜택 관련 팁
다양한 방식으로 팬을 위한 멤버십 혜택을 제공할 수 있습니다. 공개 동영상을 회원에게 선공개하는 간단한 방법부터 회원 전용의 특별한 이모티콘을 제작하는 방법 등 여러 방법으로 혜택을 만들 수 있습니다.
시청자가 회원이 되기로 결정하는 이유
시청자가 채널 회원이 되겠다고 결정하게 만드는 동기를 이해해야 합니다. 이를 바탕으로 팬에게 가장 큰 가치를 제공할 수 있는 혜택과 가격 등급 구조를 마련할 수 있습니다.
시청자가 크리에이터와 더 친밀한 관계를 맺고 싶어 하나요? 회원 가입에 따른 독점성에 관심이 있나요? 인정을 받고 싶어 하나요? 아니면 단순히 응원하는 마음을 표현하려는 것일까요?
회원에게 제공할 수 있는 가치
혜택을 설계할 때는 투자수익이 높으면서도 회원에게 가치를 제공하는 것이 무엇인지 고민해야 합니다.
독점성을 동기로 삼는 회원은 다른 곳에서는 제공되지 않는 전용 혜택과 콘텐츠를 얻기 위해 기꺼이 돈을 지불합니다. 반면 단순히 응원하는 마음을 표현하고자 회원으로 가입하는 시청자는 반드시 대단한 혜택이 돌아올 것이라 기대하지는 않습니다. 회원에게 지속적으로 제공할 수 있는 혜택을 고려하세요.
혜택과 시간 투자
혜택을 선택할 때는 해당 혜택을 제공하는 데 비용과 시간이 얼마나 드는지 고려해야 합니다.
멤버십 기본 혜택은 제공하기 쉬운 가벼운 혜택이어야 합니다.
프리미엄 혜택은 생산에 더 많은 시간과 비용이 소요되며 일반적으로 상위 등급 및 참여도가 높은 회원에게 제공됩니다.
팬에게 제공할 회원 전용 콘텐츠를 결정하세요. 가장 잘 설계된 혜택은 가치 있고 확장 가능하며 반복되는 혜택입니다.
권장사항
채널 멤버십을 제공하는 데 꼭 많은 시간과 노력을 들여야 하는 것은 아닙니다. 가입한 모든 회원에게 동일한 혜택을 제공하는 단 하나의 등급만을 사용해 부담 없는 가격대의 간단한 멤버십을 시작할 수도 있습니다.
가장 비싸거나 정성을 들인 혜택이 꼭 최고는 아닙니다. 잘 모르겠다면 팬들에게 댓글로 알려달라고 요청하거나 커뮤니티 탭의 설문조사를 활용해 원하는 것이 무엇인지 물어보세요.

tell me a little bit more about how you first set up youtube shopping.  well, i had a store for a good few years, but then I switched over to Shopify to use the integration between YouTube and Shopify.  you can do that with loads of commerce brands as well, can't you? Once the link was set up between the store and the channel, kind of automatically all my products were pulled across and then I could choose which ones I wanted to see on the channel, which ones I wanted to have under like certain videos. You should get this cast out by the way. - Okay, how do I do that? - Up and over and let go when the rod is straight. Perfect. And you're fishing. That's you ready to go. Tell me a bit more about the shopping integration.
I know like I've seen before you've like tagged some products and that's worked really well for some creators. Sometimes you don't always want to talk about the product. You just want to briefly see it in a video and then you can tag it, stick the time code and a nice way to get people direct to the store without having to send them down to the links. Mistake number three creators tend to make is not sharing it with their fans. You could start live streaming, drop your products on there as well. You could do some shorts and tag your products there. And most importantly, you can tag your product on YouTube shopping in all of your videos. Tell me a bit more about how YouTube shopping has helped you financially. Selling your own stuff, that kind of... That's unlimited. You're then owning something entirely within your control and what products you make, where you sell them or what you sell is kind of up to you. For me at least, since setting up YouTube Shopping, My merch used to be a tiny fraction of what paid my bills.
 But now the merch, the books, the products, and when the product range comes out with fishing rods and stuff, it's going to be probably half of the revenue that my channel creates. Oh, it says a fish. Yeah, it's a minnow. A minnow is just a very, very small fish. I'd let it go. It's a tiny little guy. In the past, I'd do like a trade show or an event and I'd see a little spike and it'd sort of come straight back down again. Okay. But now that I've got products tagged in a whole load of different videos across my channel, some videos that are maybe quite old, but they're still getting views. There's evergreen content. That's where the revenue starts to build and build and build and build. I've gone back into my back catalogue, found some videos that are getting views, found some videos that, you know, I talk about in my book. and then I've tagged it. And I've seen the sales sort of lift gradually ever since. What would you say is next for your channel? As my product range grows and the content evolves, I'm going to have more money to spend on the content, which means I can make better products.
 which means I can earn more money and make better videos. And it all sort of goes around in circles. The sky's the limit with that. Mistake number four, not evolving your products. It's always important to keep on evolving your products, just like you do your own channel. So thinking about how you can take your products and your business to the next level. and then you sort of slowly ease the fish towards us.

There is a member on my channel that will gift 20 to 50 memberships almost every single live stream.  and I stream twice a week, so it ends up being upwards of 100 memberships a month.  i'm emily d.  baker.  i am a legal commentator and lawyer.  i live stream on YouTube.  i host The Emily Show podcast.  welcome to The Emily Show, the internet's go-to legal analyst.  i break down the pop culture and criminal cases that everybody's talking about. We are now in session. I started doing channel memberships on my YouTube channel because my community asked me for content that really didn't fit in the content that I live stream. So my son's entire color guard is obsessed with Taylor Swift, as one does. I think any creator that wants to connect with their community, which should be all creators, would benefit from channel memberships. But it's great seeing how long you guys have been members for. It's so much fun. You don't have to have a ton of subscribers to have a thriving community on YouTube. I turned on channel memberships when my channel was just over 10,000 subscribers.
 The members-only livestream is the first Thursday of the month. month and sometimes it's a lot of fun as your channel is growing to let your community be there for the ride. Hello amazing members. The thing that I think can overwhelm creators is trying to figure out how to manage all the moving pieces. YouTube bakes in so many great benefits. You just turn them on and you don't have to facilitate anything off platform. Our member loyalty badges are by far the thing my members love the most. And that is a custom icon that I created that goes next to their name. And the way I decided to do it was to change color based on how long they'd been a member. I'm going to have members on my channel that hit the three year, four year and beyond mark. And I can't wait to celebrate with them. It's time for our members only live stream. The member only live chats. I think of it as a tailgate party before my live streams. Good to see you. If you want to chat in the time leading up to a live stream, that's turned on for members only. Same with my premiere videos.
 I also tell stories about my life. Let's have a chat about today. And then the podcast recording starts. is a lot of fun for me. I let the members in as I record my podcast. Full transparency, this is our behind the scenes. They get to see all the outtakes, the retakes. So this is how I feel. And they get to ask questions as I'm finishing recording. Do you worry about running into lawyers that we've been a little critical of? No. And that can really help me not just answer the questions the audience has as I'm recording. And I appreciate the all of the questions, but know that the podcast audience is going to have those questions too. And they get a member shout out as I answer their questions and record that behind the scenes. I'm going to have to start recording. We got to start recording. We have to start. I mean, I'm going to be recording it anyway. Might as well do it with the members. They're basically my content directors and my legal research team. The members are like, girl, what you said was this. And I think what you meant was this. And then I can reshoot. And now we're here. And I love y'all.
 Gifted Memberships is one of the coolest, things I've ever seen. Brandy, thank you for the gifted memberships. And those memberships are distributed to people that are in the chat. And then they get a full month of access to everything I have in the member spaces. I realized I was getting asked quite a lot. How do I turn on channel memberships? I now have a set blurb about how to turn on channel memberships so that people can receive them as gifts. And it's really a great trial period for people to get to experience what it's like as a member. Channel members have a lot of impact on the content that I create. So all of you that are excited for this topic, go thank the members. I regularly ask them, do you want me to cover this or that? And it's so nice knowing that those are the most invested viewers on my channel that they get to sway the direction of the content that I cover. Y'all talk amongst yourselves.
And knowing that your videos are going to perform because your core community had a part in creating it takes a lot of pressure off as a creator. Amazing law nerds. What I love about having the ability to make videos just for your members, if you want to experiment with potentially shifting your core content, you actually have now an incubator and that gives you incredible freedom as a creator to grow and to change and to experiment. Because most of us started creating videos because we had something to say and wanted to share. - Law nerds, we are called to order. - And if you keep doing that for a certain amount of years, those things are gonna grow and change. I want all of the creators to turn on channel memberships. I think they'd be happier creators if they did. We're here and I love it the most. When creators are happy and communities are happy, it makes a platform a really fun place to be. Hit record on that and then we'll hit record on this and then we'll just jump right in.

When someone joins during my live stream and becomes a member, I do this huge celebration and I yell, Lang, lang, lang, lang, lang Loud and obnoxiously, that's me trying to sound like a bell to celebrate and thank them for becoming a channel member. - Shout out to Blue Owl. - I'm becoming a member, appreciate you, thank you so much. - Hi, my name is iChristine and I offer channel memberships on my gaming channel and my react channel. On the gaming channel, we live stream, we have game plays, we play a variety of games. On the reaction channel, we react to anime, TV shows. - What about to happen? - We react to movies, pretty much everything. Having channel memberships has allowed me to find my people. So I started channel memberships at the time that they launched on the platform. I definitely was very reserved about it because it was a new concept for me.
 I knew that A, as content creators, we have to pay our bills and it doesn't take away from your authenticity. It doesn't take away from your genuine personality. or being sincere. - Thank you for the 26 months, appreciate you. - It's just creating another avenue at which you can connect with your audience, share with your audience. - Hey guys, just wanted to let you know that we have memberships here on the React channel. Having channel memberships doesn't have to be this huge difficult thing for you. There are many benefits that you can offer that don't take up a lot of time, like early access to up and coming content that you have, offering them shout outs, offering them behind the scenes sneak peeks into the new content you're working on. Also members exclusive streams. Until next time, buddy!
One of the things that I do for memberships, they have channel emotes that they can use when I do live streams, they can use them in the comments of my channel and when they come into the streams I give them shoutouts I shout out all of the members before I start talking about my life and then jumping into the game when it comes to creating benefits for your tears it's best to think about what is can I offer my audience that A, is not offering too much for a low price, but B, also something that I can keep up with and sustain throughout their membership that they will find value in. One way that I've been able to grow my memberships is with gamification. And by that, I mean on the gaming channel, I'll be like, hey, if we hit 10 new members this month, we will have a community night where tiers two and more can play with me.
 If you are a tier two member and above, you are able to join in tonight. If I'm like, hey, if we get 20 new members this month, we're going to have a movie night and you guys can choose the movie. If we hit 30 new members, then I'll let you guys choose the game and it'll be any game that you want me to play. And I will play that game live on a stream for you guys. Who won? Who? So when it comes to a live stream, people will gift memberships. Shout out to John Franklin. Thank you so much. Gifting has been a great way for my community to share the benefits of a membership with other people in the audience. Gifted memberships has been a great way for my memberships to grow. I noticed that once gifted was introduced on the platform, We went from like maybe 30 new members a month to sometimes 100 new members a month. I love this. It is so worth it to create a short intro video that goes over your tiers and your benefits for your members.
 Let me tell you the beautiful things that you can get for becoming a member. You can also repurpose that video to be a trailer for your live streams or premier. So if someone's coming into your premiere or coming into your live stream, waiting for it to start, they are played this video, which is a great way to promote memberships without you doing any additional promotions. The effect that having memberships has had on my overall YouTube experience has been absolutely amazing. You know, sometimes you gotta just show yourself some love. I've been able to find a deeper connection with my community. In the comment section, you guys Guys were showing up. Build deeper relationships with my community. Okay, y'all starting off with so much love already. And be able to create a space where I can just be me and just have fun. It's gonna be a night. It's become such a beautiful friendship. Toodles, toodles, toodles.

And I felt like if you can buy a latte once a month, you can join channel memberships. I cannot wait to share it with you. I create food content on my main channel. So when I am creating that sweet potato casserole that I hope to serve at my Thanksgiving table, here's a bite. At the end of that video, I may say, hope you've enjoyed spending time with me, enjoy this casserole, but if you wanna watch how my Thanksgiving table comes together, come hang out with us on membership. I have a membership video all about the process. It just gives it a very organic feel. For memberships, I offer three tiers. So for tier one, you get custom badges and custom emojis to use all throughout my content, which makes it really easy for me to find you. If you have a question on every video, and it's easy for me to comment back almost immediately. And then for tier two, you're going to get additional video content. And now I'm going to show you what the studio is like. I think of them as like a video diary. to the chef.
 Some of my favorite videos that I've shared on memberships have been videos in Italy with my family. It's been content with my nonna. She cooks all day every day. It's just a really great way for me to invite those core members into my home and be part of this group. Crazy fun that we have. I am fancy. Hash darn it, I will say, Boss on Then we have tier three. We also offer live hangouts. The members only livestream is what I call my sip and chat. Let's sip and chat, which is exactly what it sounds like. we sip a cocktail and we chat about anything that could be coming up food-wise, holiday. I'm very excited. It's also a really great way for me to get feedback that I can use in creating the content that I use on my main channel. Thank you for allowing me to be myself. I think when creating membership videos, a piece of advice I would give is to ask yourself, what is the most valuable to your audience?

 in as much as there's a lot of research that goes into what we're doing we are building the plane as we fly it so i'm looking literally i'm literally um putting out these podcasts but then i realize like now the world is changing in that when i have a guest for example a celebrity on my on my podcast there's certain things that i've created such a safe space that a person would share voluntarily. However, the internet is no longer a safe space like that, so there's certain parts of a video where on a different platform it does, it's a safer space. But perhaps putting a longer video on YouTube, people can just screen grab three minutes. So then that's why now we have to look at where can we put exclusive content so that my guests feel safe. And so that next time I invite someone on my podcast, they feel safe to come because their content wasn't just snapped at three minutes without context and then being spread.
 You know, we have to think of things like that. So that's when we jumped into membership. So now on YouTube, we probably have like 10 minutes of a video where we know that our guest is safe, is protected, everything is in context. But in membership, people who are paying get to have the full thing. But I also know that my guest is protected. And also people want that community aspect. I realized during COVID, a lot of us went into shelves and I think a sense of community was lost. And In the beginning with my channel, it was all about my story, my becoming, my purpose, how to do this. And then post lockdown, a year or two in, I realized that my number one need that I'm fulfilling is a need of community. People need a community, a space of belonging, like-minded people together with. And that's what membership offers. It's like like-minded people who come together for the purpose of belonging. learning about wellness.
 So with your audience in Pumi, are most of your audience based in South Africa or are they global? I think my global reach is growing. We have majority is South Africa, but second on the list, I've got Botswana, our neighboring countries. I've got Botswana, I've got Namibia, I've got Zimbabwe and we're starting to have footprint in the UK. I actually realized when I was there that a lot of South Africans moved from South Africa to live in the UK. So there's a huge... South African market in the UK. We're starting to penetrate the US market. So little by little, we're getting footprint all over the world. Yeah, but majority is still in South Africa. Are you guys kind of like planning a strategy to become more global to get more viewers in the US or the UK? Brendan, why are you blushing?
 No, because I don't think we're planning a strategy, but I think the world generally now is so much smaller because of social media. So Like Mpumi said, there's a lot of diaspora in every country. So everyone wants to feel that they belong and they want to get in touch with where they're from. And so that's a great way to enter every country's market is through people who actually are championing you. And I find that a lot of, like Mpumi said, a lot of the girls that move from here to the UK and it's obviously a culture shock. their best friend would be Mbumi and Mbumi's podcast. That's how they keep to the ground and how they remember who they are and what they relate to best. And then they share it with a friend. And then that friend shares with their husband and then the husband's like, oh, she's got a husband. Her husband is a cool guy.

Could you like talk to us a little bit about that, about, you know, not just knowing that you have that audience support, but actually seeing like tangible evidence of that support as well? Yes.
 I think one of the ways, so there are so many ways because I usually come up with things once in a while to check because it's like when I look at a lot of social media platforms, I've seen situations where it's like people have like 1 million, 2 million followers, but it's like they do meetups or they try to sell something and nobody buys because the engagement on that platform, the level of connection on that platform is different. as compared to like YouTube. YouTube is like, even if you have 10,000 subscribers, those 10,000 people would, they are watching you, they are sitting down watching you for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, the level of connection is much stronger. And I think there are situations where it's like, maybe I'm trying to raise money for, because there was a time we were trying to raise money for, for some different causes. So there are different causes happening, you know, like maybe like GoFundMe for like, there was one instance, there were these guys on the bridge, we did a video about them and we were able to raise, I think we were able to raise like almost $100,000 from the video I made.
 for that cause and then I make videos about like maybe like a business individual and then the person comes back to me and says like oh wow the video you made you know gave us this helped us get these grants or helped us get funding or helped us meet our investors so I see the impact that the platform has and I also see that the audience that I have, they are really plugged in into whatever I tell them about. - I agree as well. I found the same kind of thing is that with long form content, people are more, I wanna say invested in your life and in you because they're spending a bigger chunk of their day watching your content. Whereas with other social media sites, maybe they're just scrolling, they're kind of aimlessly distracting themselves from the real world. But when they're watching your YouTube videos, obviously it's taking time out of their day. And I know that your channel does mainly focus on long form content. We've had a couple of creators on this podcast who focus more on short form or YouTube shorts.

 first, Shopping Collections let you create lists of curated products to show on your channel and videos. To create a collection, go to Studio on mobile, then Earn. Go to Shopping, then under Collections, tap Create Collection. Your viewers will see your collections on your channel's Store tab. They'll also see them from your content under the products you've tagged. You can use collections to highlight a new product drop, a seasonal collection, your top finds of the month, or to organize by your favorite categories like beauty, fitness, or wardrobe finds.
If you're a creator in YPP with channel memberships, you can now offer members-only shorts. You can designate a short as members-only during the upload flow by going to Visibility, then selecting Members Only. You can also choose to set an existing short as members-only. Members-only shorts are a great way to provide regular, lightweight content for your members, like sneak peeks, early access announcements, short Q&As, and more. Plus, we know creators who upload members-only content two or more times per month on average see over 15 times more new members. So try it out.

 So, you know, I was definitely thinking about ways to monetize. And I don't really like the word monetize when it comes to channel memberships because it feels a bit sort of like... taking advantage of people or something like that. So I definitely thought about what would be a way that would make me feel good about involving my community in more of the stuff that I did. And then, like we said, came back to keeping that balance, really, between... me not sort of overdoing it with... 'Cause it can be a bit hard when you get people who are very intense about your channel. Right. And like, you know, parasocial relationships, that's a thing. And so, especially in the niche that I have, you know, there's a lot of people who are in quite desperate situations, you know?
 And like, so I do get quite a lot of people coming to me as kind of like an agony aunt or something. And so it has been a question of trying to balance the side of like, Okay, well, I wanted to set up memberships and I wanted to have this framework with how can I also do that and then keep my own boundaries as a human being, as a creator, and what exactly are those boundaries? Right. You know, it's different. Some people are totally fine chatting with anyone, but I feel a bit like... maybe I don't have to be like that or maybe I don't want to be like that. So it's just about finding what feels comfortable for you. Right, yeah. And I understand what you were saying. Like earlier you mentioned that There can be a bit of discomfort and I think this is quite widespread amongst creators with the idea of introducing a channel membership because they don't want to feel like they're taking money from their audience.
A mindset shift I had was that, wait a minute, I'm actually providing something that these viewers value and that they would actually be wanting to pay for. And it's also something that helps support the rest of the content on the channel as well. And so I understand what you mentioned about how, especially with the sort of content you make, you might have viewers who are not in a position to provide that kind of extra financial support. But at the same time, you might have other viewers who are, and so they can be propping it up so that everyone else can enjoy the content as well. And so, yeah, I think that's something I would encourage people who are having that feeling of, oh, I don't want to feel like I'm taking advantage to think instead, actually, there are viewers who really like the channel. and want to find a way to get involved and support a bit more. And this is one of the ways they can do that. So I think it's always worth giving it a shot.
 And another thing that you said, which was really interesting, was that you don't want to give too much of yourself away to your viewers in terms of being an agony aunt. And maybe with memberships, if your approach is providing more access to yourself, which is one of the popular ways to have a membership subscription. My question to that is, how do you approach what you actually offer members so that it doesn't become too overwhelming to you and like overwork you essentially? Yeah, I think that's a really good question. So one of the perks that I kind of feel is the main one is sort of access to a community where they can sort of chat and get to know people. And people actually made friends and started relationships and stuff on that server. So yeah, that's something that I can be a little bit hands-off. And then I have a team member who moderates that for me.
 So I'm there, but it's not something that's all on me to-- you know, start conversations and give everything because there's only so much of me I have. And I still basically do this part-time, you know, I've got two kids, so... You know, it's busy, it's a juggling act, and it's definitely something where I have to say, Okay, I have a limited amount of energy. It's not so much the time, it's also, like, what energy can I give when I have to care for children and they are my priority over this person on the internet who may be desperate, but, you know, it's so-- it's hard, basically. Like, there isn't really an easy way of doing it, but, um... I feel like, I mean, I still enjoy doing it. And like the benefit, to call myself a YouTuber and say that it's my job is like, I don't know, I say 13 year old, no, I'm not that young. When did YouTube start?
 Like, well, you know, like 20 year old me, like would be like, wow, that's so cool. And you actually get to like do it for real and support your family and, you know, grow these other people side businesses offer. I wrote a book and without my audience on YouTube, self-publishing is a little bit depressing, I think. But with an audience, there's a lot that I can do. So it's incredibly fulfilling, but that doesn't make it easy. People think, oh, you just sit there and shoot videos of yourself all day. That's so easy. It's not. No, it's not. You probably get that a lot. Yeah, it's definitely a bit of a pinch me job. because it doesn't feel like a job a lot of the time because it is enjoyable. But for me, I haven't dabbled in channel memberships yet because I'm a bit worried about sort of over promising for people. But Simi, I know that you've kind of dabbled in channel memberships, haven't you? Right, yeah.
 I first started my channel memberships in 2020, and essentially I was just saying, I'll do these live streams every so often and you get the emotes. But I wanted to figure out a way I could offer a bit more without overwhelming myself. I winded down on the memberships for a while while I figured it out, and I brought them back about a year later. But this time I was like, Okay, the way the memberships will work is you get behind the scenes access to the process of me making videos. Because a lot of my videos are quite involved, take like tens of hours to edit. And I have whole mind maps. And I've been taking pictures of all of these just for my own keepsakes. But I thought people might like to see these, so I'll compile them into sort of director's commentary style videos and I'll put those out and that can be what members get access to.
And I just kept doing that over time to the point where I now have about 50 hours of exclusive content on the channel and now it's sort of a thing where it's like, obviously I still do try to produce more regular members content but if a person becomes a member it's not like they don't have anything to watch. They have a lot of stuff they can catch up on that could last them months, maybe even up to years without me having to make new stuff. And that does relieve me of that pressure of, Oh, I'm not doing enough for my members because they already get something. As well as having the community that you mentioned. One thing I think is very underrated is that viewers of your channel don't just want to interact with the creator, they want to interact with other people who like that creator because they will have some similarities between them that they can discuss. And so providing that sort of community is a very big perk, which in itself could be worth the membership alone as well. Yeah, definitely. It's not just a community between us and the viewer, it's also between the viewers themselves. They create a community. That's definitely something I've seen.

but I feel like you are sort of doing something like that with your channel memberships on your channel where people can get a bit more of a behind the scenes look could you tell us a bit more about that? Yeah for sure so I call it B2B so it's behind the business and it's a membership that I launched around mid last year And I basically launched it because I was like, there's more stuff I wanna share on here, but I know that there's only a specific segment of my audience who actually want to see it. So there is a group of people who subscribe to my channel who are like, give me more. Like, I love that you're teaching me stuff, but like, what's going on with you? Like, how's the business doing? Show me the behind the scenes. Show me your spreadsheets, you know?
And I know that, I knew there were people like that because they would tell me, but also I am that to so many other creators. I'm like, give me more. Show me what's really going on. Right. - Yeah, when you like really like a creator, you just want as much as possible. - Yeah, exactly. Especially in like the business and entrepreneur niche. I'm like, oh my God, the more open you are with me about stuff, like the more I love it. Like I just want to really see the behind the scenes. I find it so valuable, but I know it's not everyone's cup of tea and that's totally fair. So I actually uploaded a community post and I did a poll just to be like, guys, if I was to do something along the lines where you could see more behind the scenes stuff, like, would you be interested? Overwhelmingly, yes, like got so many responses. So I was like, do you know what? I'm just gonna launch it. And I've loved it ever since. It's like my little therapeutic thing where I can just chat and catch up with like my B2B members and really just talk about the behind the scenes of the business and really engage with them. And I can always make sure that I'm responding to like all of their comments. And if I'm going to launch something for my business, I tell them about it first, like months before I've told anyone else just to get their feedback.
 Like it's incredible. I really enjoy it. Definitely. It kind of reminds me as, you know, back in the day, people would launch a second channel, which would be almost like more personal, more like the vlogs. It kind of reminds me of that. So you have like your educational videos on your channel, then you're through channel memberships, you have the personal side. I've never heard anyone use channel memberships in that way before, but that's such an interesting way to look at it. It's such a great way to segment your audience. It is an amazing way to be like, okay, this is how I create content specifically for this group of people. Because my membership is priced at, I think they're priced at like 199 a month. So I purposely was like, I'm not gonna make it an expensive thing. It's not a revenue driver for my business. It's purely like an engagement driver. because I always like to talk to people like other creators about the importance of having like advocates as part of your kind of strategy. And when I talk about advocates, I'm referring to that group of people who are just really, really invested in you.
 And they tell others about your channel and they feel like they know you on a deeper level beyond maybe the content that they're sharing. And when it comes to my kind of niche and educational content, it could be difficult to have people like that in your audience because everyone's just so used to you teaching you something and then carrying on moving. Like the loyalty isn't necessarily as there as it could be elsewhere. So one way to do that is to find a way to create that personal content and share it with people who are really interested. And because I don't necessarily wanna share too much of my personal life with everyone, so I don't necessarily want a second channel, this was perfect for me, you know? - Yeah, definitely. - I do a similar thing with my memberships actually, where it's people getting to see how the videos got made. I'll show them the editing project and all of that stuff. And I'll talk through some of the difficulties of making certain videos. So I definitely relate with that.
 And I feel like when you do have it to be a thing where people have to be members to access that content, you almost feel a bit more comfortable making that content because you know that these are people that are actually like really big supporters of what you're doing. And so you can be a bit more candid with them about that creation process. Oh my gosh, so much more candid. That's why I was saying it feels like therapy. Like I feel so comfortable filming those videos. I don't, it's even like the prep for it. Sometimes I will go through the previous videos because they'll tell me if there's something that they want me to talk about. So that's usually when I'll figure out what I'm going to talk about that in that next month's video. But even when I've done that, I'll have a list of what to talk about and I don't even need to prep it because it's not like I'm doing a YouTube video where I'm like, okay, make sure the intro is snappy. We've got to hook people quickly and like make sure you're explaining it in a way that makes more sense and it's engaging and blah, blah, blah. that's less important because I know people are just going to watch it because they want that value. They don't mind if I ramble for a second. I don't have to re-film that part. Like, it's okay.
So it's really nice. I love it. I personally, I don't have channel memberships on. I know both of you do. I've always been a little bit concerned about asking people to pay to watch my videos because I've always given it for free and people have always been able to access my life, my personal life for free. Do you find that people are happy to pay that to support your channel? - You know, when I have this conversation with a lot of creators, 'cause I've spoken to so many people who feel the same way, the selling part can feel really awkward, but I always say like, it's to flip the way that you're approaching it. So you're not trying to get someone who would never invest that money to invest their money. That's not who you're necessarily selling to. You're just letting people know who would want to invest their money that you have this thing yeah so it's not like you're saying please buy my membership please give me your money there are people out there who would want to do that and you're just letting them know that they can yeah you know yeah yeah no definitely I think like from my perspective being that um I'm not so much of an educational channel, more of a gaming entertainment channel.
 I have had that feeling of, oh, all my other videos are free. Why would I charge for these ones? But my perspective of it was that I'm giving people something that I wouldn't have been, you know, making otherwise. So it is a sort of new style of content. And yeah, again, that behind the scenes thing is something that I found people are wanting to pay for. And there's also the aspect of a lot of people just want to support channels. I actually support a lot of channels and don't watch their like exclusive content because I just want to support them. And you'll be surprised how many creators and people out there just want to support their favorite creator. And so, yeah, that's something that I encourage people like, just start a membership. And, you know, if you have extra stuff you can put out for those members, oftentimes they'll be really happy to see it. Yeah.

출처 : 유튜브 [youtube creator]
 And you were even mentioning that with your membership content, You don't do the whole thing of trying to get everything perfect, having a script and all that. It's very laid back and casual. And I think a thing a lot of creators struggle with is this idea of, Oh, it's gonna be too much extra work creating all of that exclusive content and I think one thing to note for them is a lot of these members are your most dedicated viewers. They're the people who won't mind if something isn't super polished and so it doesn't mean give them something that isn't worth watching at all but I think you can relieve yourself of that pressure a bit. And it allows you to lessen the burden of, Oh, I have to create all this extra content. Even if it's just a quick behind the scenes thing, I think. - Yeah. - Great, I agree for that. Do you have any things to say about the idea of it'd be too much extra work to have this membership offering? - Well, the thing is, is we have the... the power to decide what this membership is gonna look like.
 And there are so many different options that you can use to implement your membership to really figure out, okay, what's this gonna look like? So when you're at that stage, come up with a plan that you are excited by, one that you actually wanna do. And I always say with anything like that is to start small and then add to it. So, and that's, I always have to tell myself that because I am notorious for doing the opposite, but I have to really force myself to do it. Because when I first wanted to do the membership, I was like, right, I'm going to do weekly videos and I'm going to do this and that. And I was like, no, I just need to relax. Just start small. So I was like, I'm just going to do one video a month and I'm going to start off allowing myself to be flexible and relaxed with how I create that video and even the date in which it goes live.
 If you're open and honest with your audience about that, and also they know what they're getting like you're not trying to disguise the membership as something that it's not then you'll know that the people who decide to join the membership are the ones who actually want that and they're okay with that and everyone's on the same page we tend to get in our heads and overthink things so much especially when it comes to asking like others for money and i think we forget that your audience have agency and they are deciding to pay the money. I think sometimes we feel like we're forcing it from people. I'm like, no, no, they don't have to. People are choosing to. - It sounds like you're a big advocate for the membership style. It sounds like you've gotten really well with, but what would you say is the best benefit as a creator of having channel membership? For me specifically, it's the fact that I can just have these like private convos with my audience and it really helps my business as well. Just having like a group of people who I can run ideas by outside of my husband and mum. Like it really, really helps. So for me, it's definitely that.
 But I also know for other creators, having reoccurring income is like an absolute game changer. Like it's something that I work to have in my business as well, outside of the memberships and outside of my YouTube channel. So that would be a huge benefit as well if I went down that route. - Right, right. Especially in like the world of live streaming, it's quite common for people to have a paid membership or subscription to their favorite streamer. And I think something about that recurring revenue keeps you insulated from the idea of, Oh, what if I don't do as well views-wise next month? You know that your most dedicated viewers are there and they're supporting you and helping you out.
 I've seen a lot of creators who started a membership or even on another platform some sort of recurring paid membership thing and that was the difference between them being able to continue making the videos they enjoy and their audience enjoys and not so yeah i think it's an if it's an option to someone they should definitely explore it yeah you never know yeah was that ever a fine was the financial side of it ever a target for you when you started channel membership did you think about that recurring income every month Honestly, because of the way I've set my business up, there's a few different income streams. I wasn't looking for a new income stream. If I was going to do something else, I knew that there needed to be a different motivator behind it because I wanted it to be this casual thing that I do for fun. and I know what my personality type is. And if I decided it was an income stream, it would look very different and it would take a different amount of time. I just would have approached it differently. So for me, it wasn't like an income driven thing, but that's not to say that one day that might not change.
 I think it also depends of like what you're balancing at the moment. And I just know that right now it can't be that for me, but in the future, if I had more time, maybe it would be.  yeah.  definitely.  and i know a lot, another thing that people sometimes struggle with, with that is they might create the membership and then they tell nobody about it.  i've got it enabled.  no one knows about it. And one thing I find is that it's really important to let people know, 'cause you'll be surprised. You might have said, Oh, I've already mentioned it five times. And then someone will be like, Wait, what is this membership thing? So mentioning it repeatedly is something I find to be really key. And because it integrates so well with live streaming, whenever someone becomes a member, it shows up on the screen and everyone can see that. And more people become aware of memberships being a thing. Do you actually prioritize promoting your memberships or do you let people know find it? What's your approach to that? So first of all, I completely agree with your point regarding the fact that people need to hear about it quite a few times.
 There's actually like a really old marketing phrase that the consumer needs to hear a message seven times before they take action. And that's not purchase before they take action. So that could be like going on your website, like they're not even purchasing yet and that's seven times. And then a lot of people think, okay, that means I have to talk about it seven times. And I'm like, no, because everyone doesn't hear you every time you talk about it. So basically you have to talk about it a lot before someone actually hears and takes action and that's okay. And it can feel like you're consistently repeating yourself and it can feel like you're being really salesy because you're aware of how many times you've said it. So to you, it feels like a million times, but you're forgetting that to everyone else, it doesn't quite feel like that. My strategy for mine is I will mention the membership when I'm creating content that I know will appeal to people who would want the membership. So if I'm doing like a vlog style video, like doing one today, I'll mention it in today's video because I know the people watching are the kind of people who would want more behind the scenes stuff, but I wouldn't necessarily mention it in some of my other content where I know the audience It's the same, like same, same, but different. - Yeah, definitely.

출처 : 유튜브 [youtube creator]
They also want to hear from other creators, which is a big part of my podcast. I'm interviewing other creators. They want to hear from other creators and they want to hear their backgrounds and more kind of in-depth questions, which include like, what's your strategy, but also includes like, how did you get started on YouTube? What was your relationship like with it in the beginning? Not everyone wants... both types. I know the audience is the same, but sometimes the consumption habits are different.
So I wanted to create a place where the Create a Project podcast could really thrive and where people who wanted that could go and know that is exclusively what they're gonna get. And I definitely wanted a video element to it as well, because I'm a YouTuber at heart and I know the power of video. And I guess you wanted every subscriber on that channel to be there for the podcast specifically. Because that's something I've thought about a lot. And I think a lot of creators think about is I want to make a new style of content where the audience isn't totally different. but it's going to be a different style should I put that somewhere else and I do have like multiple channels but right now I'm in like a phase of my YouTube career or whatever where I'm like I just want to keep everything in one place if you're a subscriber of mine and you don't like my live streams that is totally cool just don't watch those watch when I put an actual video and I don't mind if like these types of videos do better than these types I'm just like It's in one place. If you want to find me, you know where I am. And I think that's a great strategy as well, like 100%.
 I think another side of it from a commercial perspective, it gives me more opportunities for the overarching business and brand. Because now I've got personal brand where I've got my partners who I work with, who I create content for and what's monetized. And then now I have this other channel that will be monetized and have its own brand partners as well once I'm ready to kind of flip that switch, which I'm not quite doing yet. but that's like a new avenue for me so from a commercial standpoint I like that side of it yeah definitely awesome could you talk through your approach to finding brands that align with your values and that you actually want to work with on your channel. Yeah, this is really where that cheat code comes in again from just working in marketing and stuff, because I used to work in partnerships marketing. So my whole job was to partner either creators or like ambassadors and celebrities with like brands and stuff. So I saw a lot of the behind the scenes, the contract negotiation. I saw a lot of the pitches when I had my own boutiques and I had obviously like social media presence.
 people would message me asking for a collab and it would be the worst DMs you've ever seen in your life. It would literally be like, Collab question mark? And I'm like, No, I'm not gonna give you all of my money, just message me collab. So because of that experience, I feel like I had a really good handle on how brand partnerships work and why they work. And I feel like when you can really pinpoint, okay, what am I going to get from a brand as part of this partnership? But also what am I going to give a brand in return? That is when you can get really good at your pitches and you can get really great partners on board. So that was like the first thing that I wanted to figure out. I basically wanted to figure out, okay, what's the value that I can offer a brand? So I started working with Brand when I had maybe like just under 2000 subscribers. So it was a fairly new account, but I very quickly was like, okay, I think now's the time. And then I was like booked straight away because I was just pitching to people. And I made it really clear that my value offering was, you know, I don't have a huge audience, but I have a a very targeted audience.
 So I was working with brands who were trying to run marketing campaigns where they were trying to reach a very specific audience 'cause therefore this is a good fit. I wasn't working with brands who were like, we just wanna reach millions of people 'cause I can't help you do that. But at the time I could help you reach 2000 very engaged entrepreneurs, like social media enthusiasts. So that's very much my strategy at the beginning. And then over time, my value has kind of changed. So now the way I pitch myself is slightly different. I can help with brands awareness a little bit more. I can help with credibility more because I've been in the game for a little bit now. So it's just about understanding what the value is that you can offer a brand and not being shy to tell them that. Make it super clear in your pitch, like straight away, be like, look, this is what I can help you with. Because we often forget as creators, the reason why brands are working with us is because they need our help with something. They're not just like, I think you'd look really cute in my shoes. They need help with something. So when you identify what that is and you meet them there, that's usually when you can get some really cool deals. Really cool. Yeah.
