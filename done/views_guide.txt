First, make sure that your titles and descriptions, that you're also uploading translated titles and descriptions so that when we recommend or return and search these videos in different languages, users can see those and know what they would be clicking on. The second thing is to recognize that there's benefits from having more of your catalog available in a particular language. So when a viewer does discover your channel, they can watch more than just like one video. The more catalog that they have to choose from, the more likely it is that they'll find another video that they'll enjoy watching, which is a great signal back to us that you provided great value. So we've seen in particular creators who dub at least 80 of the viewership of their channel. I think it's watch time. Yeah. Tend to have more success than those who dub less.
Recognize that there's kind of a critical mass in terms of offering a catalog in a language. So you might want to focus on getting to that 80 of your catalog within a few languages rather than doing 20 with more languages. Yeah, and that's current catalog based on watch time. It doesn't really matter.

동영상 최적화 팁
As a creator, how can I make videos that are noticeable and make viewers keep watching them? I will introduce some things to be careful about when making successful videos on YouTube. To make videos that are easy to find and more appealing to viewers, the image, title, and explanation of previews must be interesting and accurate. The information provided in the preview image, title, and description will not only help you recommend videos on the YouTube system, but also tell viewers why they should watch the video. When adding the information, follow the YouTube Community Guide. To create a video of a high level, use the card and the final screen. This feature will help you increase your viewing time and channel participation. The card is displayed at the top right of the video to encourage viewers to watch more of your content.
 The final screen is displayed at the end of the video, and you can add more videos, view or subscribe to the play list for viewers. Both functions can be added during the upload process. If there are multiple videos on the channel, you can use the Playlist and Channel Section. If you use the Playlist, you can group multiple videos so that viewers can watch your videos in a row. It will help you increase the viewing time of the channel, which is an important measurement item on YouTube. You can group videos as you want, not only the topic and form. If you have a playlist, you can add it to the channel homepage as a section. In the section, you can set the layout of the channel homepage. The section is composed of a video and playlist, and it is useful for organizing and showing content made for channel visitors.
 If you go to the YouTube Studio's custom settings page, you can add a section. The most important element to succeed on YouTube is to remember that it's content made by yourself. You don't have to be perfect. Make videos based on your favorite topics. Viewers are waiting. Thank you for watching.

썸네일 및 제목 팁
시청자에게 동영상이 무엇에 대한 것인지 어떻게 알릴 수 있을까요? 일반적으로 시청자는 썸네일과 제목을 먼저 확인합니다. 이러한 정보는 동영상의 내용을 간략하게 소개하고 시청자가 시청 여부를 결정하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 흥미로운 사실은 실적이 우수한 동영상의 90%가 맞춤 썸네일을 사용한다는 점입니다.
눈에 띄는 썸네일 디자인
동영상 타겟층이 누구인가요? 구독자를 타겟팅하는 콘텐츠라면 친한 친구처럼 친숙한 기능을 강조해 보세요. 일반 시청자를 타겟팅하는 콘텐츠라면 누구나 공감할 수 있는 행동과 감정에 초점을 맞춰 보세요. 예를 들면 놀란 얼굴 표정을 썸네일에 사용해 보세요.
'3분할 법칙'을 적용하여 흥미로운 이미지를 만들 수 있습니다. 그런 다음 이미지에 브랜딩 및 설명 텍스트를 오버레이하세요. 문구를 추가할 때는 읽기 편한 글꼴을 사용하세요.
디자인은 너무 복잡하게 만들지 마세요. 색상과 구성을 역동적으로 사용하면 시선을 끌 수 있지만 지나치면 오히려 독이 될 수 있습니다.
썸네일은 기기마다 다르게 표시되므로 썸네일 이미지를 가능한 한 크게 만드세요.
시청자마다 취향이 다르고 썸네일 스타일은 시간이 지남에 따라 변할 수 있습니다. 내 커뮤니티에서 효과가 있는 방법을 지속적으로 파악하는 것이 중요합니다. 신규 시청자의 관심을 끌 수 있도록 예전 썸네일을 트렌드에 맞게 바꿔 보는 것도 좋습니다.
제목 작성 방법
정확성을 추구하세요. 제목이 동영상 내용을 정확하게 반영해야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면 시청자가 시청을 중단할 수도 있고 내 동영상의 발견 가능성에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다.
간결하게 작성하세요. 시청자가 제목의 일부만 볼 수도 있습니다. 최대한 짧게 작성하되 가장 중요한 단어를 앞쪽에 배치하는 것이 좋습니다. 에피소드 번호와 브랜드는 뒤에 배치하세요.
과도한 대문자 및 이모티콘 사용을 삼가세요. 감정이나 동영상의 특별한 요소를 강조하고자 할 때 신중하게 사용하세요. 예: '우리 아이들이 로봇을 만들었어요!!!!!"
동영상 제목 유형
다음과 같은 방법으로 시청자의 관심을 유도할 수 있습니다.
예상 콘텐츠를 명확하게 설명하는 검색 가능한 제목을 통해 비슷한 콘텐츠를 검색하는 시청자에게 쉽게 도달할 수 있습니다.
특정 주제의 콘텐츠를 찾고 있지 않은 시청자에게도 호기심을 자극하고 관심을 유도할 수 있는 흥미로운 제목을 사용합니다.

데이터 세부 분석
아이디어를 더 얻고 싶다면 YouTube 분석의 조사 통계를 사용하여 내 시청자층 및 YouTube 전반의 시청자가 YouTube에서 무엇을 검색하는지 알아볼 수 있습니다.
YouTube 분석의 시청자층 탭에서 내 시청자가 본 다른 동영상들을 확인하여 썸네일과 제목에 대한 아이디어도 얻을 수 있습니다.
다음 측정항목을 사용하여 각 시청자층에 내 썸네일과 제목이 얼마나 효과적이었는지를 살펴보세요.
모든 연령대의 경우 게시 후 첫 24시간 동안 홈 및 추천에서 발생한 클릭률(CTR)을 확인합니다. 이 수치는 평균 노출수(IMP)가 넘는 동영상에서 확인하세요. 홈 및 추천은 시청자가 새 동영상과 채널을 자주 탐색하는 곳입니다.
구독자의 경우 게시 후 24시간 동안 구독 피드에서 발생한 클릭률(CTR)을 확인합니다. 구독자는 플랫폼의 다른 곳에서 내 동영상을 볼 수도 있지만 구독 피드는 가장 참여도가 높은 팬을 반영합니다.
권장 조치
썸네일을 검토하여 내 동영상의 매력을 잘 나타내는지 확인해 보세요. 썸네일 정책도 준수해야 합니다.
촬영 중에 사진을 찍으면 동영상을 업로드할 때 여러 가지 썸네일 옵션을 사용할 수 있습니다.
누가 내 동영상을 볼지, 어떤 위치에서 찾을지를 생각해 보고 검색 가능한 제목과 흥미로운 제목 중에서 선택하세요.
동영상을 게시한 후에는 YouTube 분석에서 측정항목을 확인하여 썸네일의 제목과 효과를 측정하는 것도 잊지 마세요.

동영상 설명을 위한 팁
YouTube는 세계 최대 규모 수준의 검색엔진입니다. 키워드를 잘 활용해 설명을 작성하면 시청자들이 검색을 통해 동영상을 더 쉽게 찾을 수 있습니다.
설명 작성
설명은 YouTube 알고리즘 및 시청자에게 동영상의 내용을 알려줍니다. 설명은 두 부분으로 나누어 생각할 수 있습니다. 첫 번째는 시청자가 데스크톱이나 휴대기기에서 '더보기'를 클릭하기 전에 보게 되는 내용이고 두 번째는 클릭한 후에 보게 되는 내용입니다. 시청자는 설명의 처음 몇 줄부터 보게 되므로, 이 부분에 동영상 설명을 넣는 것이 좋습니다.
설명의 두 번째 부분에는 시청자가 자세히 알아볼 수 있도록 채널에 대한 기타 정보를 추가할 수 있습니다. 업로드되는 모든 동영상에 기본 채널 정보를 추가하는 기본 설명을 만들 수도 있습니다. 설명에는 최대 5,000자가 허용됩니다.
동영상마다 고유한 설명을 작성하세요. 그러면 시청자가 검색을 통해 동영상을 찾기 쉬워지고, 다른 비슷한 동영상 사이에서 더 눈에 띄게 됩니다.
동영상의 내용을 나타내는 주요 단어 1~2개를 찾아, 설명과 제목을 작성할 때 그 단어를 눈에 띄게 사용합니다. YouTube 분석 및 Google Ads 키워드 플래너의 조사 탭을 사용하여 인기 키워드와 그 동의어를 파악하세요. 이러한 단어를 포함하면 검색으로 발생하는 트래픽을 극대화할 수 있습니다.

설명 맞춤설정
설명 입력란에는 텍스트만 표시할 수 있지만 형식을 지정할 수는 있습니다. 텍스트를 굵게 또는 기울임꼴로 표시하거나 텍스트에 취소선을 적용할 수 있습니다.
휴대기기에서는 서식을 지정하려는 텍스트를 강조 표시하여 수정 바를 연 다음 서식 지정 옵션을 선택할 수 있습니다. 설명에 글머리기호 목록을 추가하려면 줄의 시작 부분에 '*,' '+,' 또는 '-'를 입력하고 공백을 넣으세요. 컴퓨터에서는 맨 아래 옵션을 사용하여 설명란에서 바로 텍스트 서식을 지정할 수 있습니다.
대화형 요소를 추가해서 조회수를 높이고, 공동작업을 소개하고, 구독자 기반을 확대할 수 있습니다.
동영상이 길 경우 동영상 챕터를 사용해 시청자가 중요한 부분으로 건너뛸 수 있도록 합니다.
관련 동영상의 재생목록으로 연결되는 링크를 제공합니다.
공동작업을 소개하면서 도움을 준 채널과 사람들을 멘션합니다.
시청자에게 중요한 링크를 표시하려면 채널 프로필 링크를 추가하세요.
데이터 세부 분석하기
동영상이 YouTube 검색결과에 나타나게 하려면 어떻게 해야 할까요? YouTube 분석에서 '시청자가 내 콘텐츠를 발견한 방법' 보고서를 확인하여 콘텐츠 도달범위 및 참여도를 확인합니다. 설명에 이러한 단어가 누락되어 있나요? 내 동영상을 직접 검색으로 찾는다고 가정해 보세요. 검색창에 어떤 단어를 입력할까요? 설명에 이러한 단어를 포함하면 시청자가 내 콘텐츠를 더 쉽게 찾을 수 있습니다.
분석에 있는 '시청자가 내 콘텐츠를 찾는 방법' 보고서는 시청자가 내 콘텐츠를 찾을 때 가장 많이 사용하는 검색어를 보여줍니다.
권장사항
기본 설명 입력란을 작성하면 모든 동영상에 자동으로 추가 정보를 표시할 수 있습니다.
YouTube 검색, 동영상 보기 페이지, 다양한 휴대기기에서 동영상 설명이 어떻게 표시되는지 확인하세요. 가장 중요한 정보가 원하는 대로 표시되나요?

검색 및 탐색 팁
YouTube는 각 시청자별로 즐길 가능성이 가장 큰 동영상을 소개합니다. YouTube의 검색 및 탐색 시스템은 시청자 개개의 다양한 관심사에 맞는 동영상을 찾습니다. YouTube의 목표는 사람들이 좋아하는 동영상을 더 많이 보게 하여 YouTube를 꾸준히 방문하도록 유도하는 것입니다.
YouTube 시스템은 어떤 동영상을 선호하나요?
YouTube 시스템은 크리에이터가 제작하는 동영상의 유형에 대해 특정한 의견을 갖지 않으며 특정 형식을 선호하지도 않습니다. 동영상 순위는 실적과 시청자 맞춤설정(시청 및 검색 기록 포함)에 따라 정해집니다.
YouTube는 시청자별로 맞춤 동영상을 어떻게 추천하나요?
YouTube는 시청자의 다양한 신호에 따라 다음 정보를 파악하여 동영상을 추천합니다.
시청자가 과거에 시청한 동영상: 시스템은 이 정보를 통해 시청자가 좋아할 만한 동영상을 표시할 수 있습니다.
주로 함께 시청하는 동영상: 시스템은 시청자가 시청할 가능성은 높지만 아직 노출되지 않은 동영상을 파악할 수 있습니다.
사용자가 특정 채널 또는 주제를 시청하는 비율: 시스템은 이를 통해 시청자에게 추천할 콘텐츠를 파악할 수 있습니다.


YouTube 시스템은 동영상 실적을 어떻게 확인하나요?
YouTube 시스템은 동영상이 시청자에게 추천될 때 동영상의 실적을 확인합니다. 예를 들어 동영상이 시청자에게 추천될 때 시청자가 동영상을 시청하는지, 무시하는지, 아니면 '관심 없음'을 클릭하는지를 확인한 후 시청자가 다른 동영상으로 이동하지 않고 머물고 있는지를 살펴봅니다. 시스템은 평균 시청 지속 시간 및 평균 시청 비율(%)을 순위 결정에 필요한 신호로 사용합니다. 마지막으로 좋아요/싫어요 및 시청 후 설문조사 결과를 사용하여 시청자가 해당 동영상을 좋아했는지 확인합니다.
내 동영상의 시청자 수에 영향을 주는 외부 요인은 무엇인가요?
시청자는 세 가지 주요 요소를 통해 유입됩니다.
주제 관심도
주제 관심도는 특정 주제에 대해 얼마나 많은 전 세계 사용자가 관심을 보이고 동영상을 시청하는지를 보여줍니다.
다른 주제보다 광범위한 관심을 끄는 주제도 있지만 관심의 정도는 시간이 지나면서 변할 수 있습니다.
경쟁
YouTube 시스템은 시청자가 시청할 수 있는 모든 채널의 동영상에 순위를 매깁니다.
내 동영상의 측정항목이 양호하더라도 다른 채널 동영상의 실적이 훨씬 더 높으면 노출수가 낮아질 수 있습니다.
성수기
YouTube 트래픽은 연중 시기별로 달라질 수 있습니다.
시청자의 거주 국가 또는 일상의 상황 등을 생각해 보고 주요 연휴 동안의 시청률 변동을 예상해보세요.
동영상이 추천되는 방식에 영향을 미치는 요소는 무엇인가요?
YouTube 시스템은 시청자의 시청 기록, 동영상 실적 및 참여도 측정항목, 궁극적으로는 시청자가 동영상에 도달하는 데 도움을 주는 외부 요소의 영향을 받습니다.
권장사항
시청자가 좋아하는 콘텐츠에 집중하세요. 그렇게 해서 사용자가 동영상을 본다면 맞춤 콘텐츠도 결국 따라가기 때문입니다.
시청자가 어떤 동영상을 가장 좋아하는지 자문해 보세요. 시청자는 내 채널을 얼마나 자주 시청하고 싶어 할까요? 이러한 질문에 대한 도움을 받으려면 내 시청자층을 파악해야 합니다.

신규 시청자 및 재방문 시청자 팁
YouTube 분석의 시청자층 탭에서 시청자 기반에 대해 자세히 살펴볼 수 있습니다. 관련 차트에서 시청자가 누구이고, 내 채널에 얼마나 자주 방문하며, 어디에서 유입되는지를 확인할 수 있습니다. 시청자를 알면 참여도가 높은 시청자를 위한 콘텐츠 전략을 계획하는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다.
재방문 시청자
시청자층 탭의 신규 시청자 및 재방문 시청자 데이터는 커뮤니티의 성장에 관한 유용한 정보를 수집할 때 중요합니다.
재방문 시청자: 이전에 내 채널을 시청했으며 추가 시청을 위해 다시 방문한 시청자를 말합니다. 신규 시청자보다 재방문 시청자 수가 많다면 다음에 해당할 가능성이 높습니다.
비슷한 형식이나 주제를 게시하거나 동일한 진행자와 꾸준히 작업합니다.
시청자가 계속 채널을 방문한다는 점을 감안하여 동영상 간의 시청률을 안정적으로 유지합니다.
신규 시청자를 확보하기 위한 아이디어:
콘텐츠 실험을 통해 더 폭넓은 시청자층의 관심을 유도해 보세요. 관심 있는 주제에 대한 새로운 동영상과 더 많은 사용자에게 도달할 수 있도록 고안된 동영상을 활용하면 정규 프로그램에 새로운 시청자를 확보하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 예를 들어 라이프스타일 크리에이터는 패션 위크에 대한 브이로그를 만들어 보거나 셰프는 새로운 레스토랑이나 음식 트렌드를 검토해 볼 수 있습니다.
새 콘텐츠를 패키징하는 방법을 살펴보세요. 패키징에는 제목과 썸네일이 포함됩니다. 나를 모를 수 있는 새로운 시청자에게 다가가기 위해 디자인을 어떻게 변경할지도 생각해 보세요.
신규 시청자는 선택한 기간 동안 내 채널에서 처음으로 동영상을 시청한 시청자입니다. 다음 사항에 유의하세요.
재방문 시청자보다 신규 시청자가 더 많다면 시청자는 채널 전체의 주제보다 특정 주제나 동영상에 더 관심을 가지고 있을 수 있습니다. 충성도 높은 시청자가 많지 않을 수는 있지만, 더 광범위한 시청자층과 더 많은 시청자에게 다가갈 기회가 더 많이 있습니다.
새 시청률은 '방법 안내' 채널을 통해 확인할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 시청자가 특정 질문에 답하는 동영상을 시청하는 채널이 여기에 해당합니다. 시청자는 답변을 받은 후에 다시 방문하지 않을 수도 있습니다.
더 충성도 높은 시청자층을 구축하는 방법에 대해 생각해 보세요.
주제 또는 형식이 더 일관된 콘텐츠를 만들어 보세요.
이미 시청자에게 인기 있는 것으로 검증된 주제의 동영상 시리즈를 만듭니다.
댓글에 답글 달기 등 커뮤니티와 더 많이 소통하는 방법을 생각해 봅니다.
마지막으로 신규 시청자 및 재방문 시청자 수가 동일하게 유지되는 경우도 있습니다. 이러한 조합은 새로운 시청자를 확보하는 동시에 참여도를 유지하는 데 효과적일 수 있습니다.
조합이 균일했던 기간에 제작한 콘텐츠 유형에 주의를 기울입니다. 채널에서 효과를 보였던 방법과 이를 지속할 방법을 생각해 보세요.
순 시청자
 수
순 시청자 수 데이터를 활용하면 시청자 규모를 더 명확하게 파악할 수 있습니다. 시청자 데이터는 지정된 기간에 내 동영상을 시청하기 위해 방문한 시청자 수를 추정하는 목적으로도 사용할 수 있습니다. 한 사람이 컴퓨터와 휴대기기를 번갈아 사용하거나 여러 번 시청하더라도 순 시청자 한 명으로 집계됩니다.
다음은 순 시청자 수 데이터를 활용할 수 있는 몇 가지 방법입니다.
순 시청자 수를 구독자 수와 비교하면 구독자 이외의 더 많은 시청자층에 다가가는 데 도움이 된 동영상을 확인할 수 있습니다.
동영상에서 새로운 시청자의 관심을 끌었던 부분을 파악합니다. 이 정보는 동영상을 게시하기 전과 후의 채널 순 시청자 수를 비교하여 확인할 수 있습니다.
구독자 수가 순 시청자 수보다 많은 경우:
걱정하지 마세요. 크리에이터 대부분의 채널에서 발견되는 추세입니다. 구독자는 다음과 같은 이유로 시간이 지남에 따라 활동이 줄어들 수 있습니다.
동영상을 가끔만 시청함
더 이상 내 채널을 확인하지 않음
더 이상 YouTube에 로그인하지 않음
그래도 조치를 취하려면 다음 안내를 따르세요.
시청자에게 채널 알림을 사용 설정하도록 안내합니다.
더 짧은 기간을 분석한 내용을 보고 있을 수 있습니다. 시간 범위를 확장하여 새로 업로드하면 시청자가 다시 방문하여 순 시청자 수가 증가할 수 있습니다.
신규 시청자를 확보하기 위한 아이디어를 생각해 보세요.
다른 크리에이터와 공동작업을 해보세요.
트렌드 및 시즌 이벤트에 관한 콘텐츠를 제작해 보세요.
썸네일과 제목을 최대한 활용하여 검색 가능성을 높이세요. 업로드 및 재생목록을 통해 항상 채널을 업데이트하세요.
구독자 수
재방문 시청자가 구독자 수보다 적은 이유는 무엇인가요?
구독자 수는 내 YouTube 채널을 팔로우하기 위해 구독한 시청자의 수를 나타내며 내 동영상을 본 시청자의 수를 나타내지는 않습니다. 시청자는 보통 수십 개의 채널을 구독하며 구독 중인 채널에 업로드되는 새 동영상을 모두 시청하는 것은 아닙니다.
YouTube의 추천 시스템은 재방문 시청자에 맞춰 최적화되나요?
추천 시스템은 시청자가 즐길 가능성이 높은 동영상과 채널을 추가로 제안하는 데 목적이 있습니다. 시청자가 다른 동영상 시청을 위해 정기적으로 채널을 재방문하면 추후 내 채널의 동영상이 추천될 가능성이 더 높아집니다.
구독자의 동영상 시청 시간은 구독자가 아닌 사용자의 2배에 이릅니다. 비구독자와 비교하여 구독자가 좋아하고 시청하는 콘텐츠를 살펴봅니다. 이 정보를 통해 구독자가 장기적인 팬이 되도록 유도하는 방법을 생각해 볼 수 있습니다.

Hey creators, let's dive into this month's roundup. When you stream on mobile, your live streams may now surface to anyone browsing the Shorts feed. Viewers can tap directly in their feed to be redirected to your live stream. We hope this helps your live content reach new audiences.

유튜브 채널 [youtube creator]
 - So Jade, you mentioned earlier that you like to look for your comments to get an idea of what your audience wants. You like the research tab as well. What other aspects of analytics do you look at and how do you use analytics to inform your content strategy? - Yeah, so I'm in my analytics all the time. I actually have to like set limits on it. I always say there's like two different types of creators. There's the like creatives and then there's the nerds. And the creatives are the ones who just love to create on a fly and they don't necessarily need too much structure. You know, they like to just be free and create whatever visually looks appealing, whatever catches their eye. And then there's the nerds like me who spend a lot of time in the analytics and everything's planned and everything's scheduled in advance. And I definitely, I'm like firmly in in the nerd camp, which means that sometimes I have to take a step back and be like, okay, but remember to be creative. - Yeah. - Same way the creatives need to stop and be like, oh, I need to check my analytics, you know? - I get that. I actually often have periods of like switching between the two.
 I have a season where I'm just super into analytics and I'm like, Okay, I can't look at this anymore. Just make whatever and see what happens. - Yeah, I think I'm definitely more the creator. I forget to look at my analytics and then every now and again, I'm like, Oh yeah, I should probably see what people actually like and watch. - I just think, Is this working? - Yeah, you're so right. There definitely are two types of creators. - Yeah, they really are. Yeah, I'm firmly in the nerd basket. I love looking at my analytics on YouTube specifically because they're so robust. Like there's so much data there that you can get. And the way I like to look at it is kind of like a funnel back to like the good old marketing stuff. I always say I'm one of the few people who actually get value for my degree. So money well spent there. But I always like to look at it from like a funnel marketing approach. So when I'm looking at how my content is performing, I will first look at the top, which is the like awareness stuff, the impressions basically. So are people seeing that my videos are even being being created because if people aren't seeing my videos around YouTube, then they're never going to know that I'm creating content and they're never going to click on them. So I'll first look at my impressions.
 Are they going up? Are they going down? Is it seasonal, etc.? And then I'll take the next level down, which for me is your click-through rate. And that's like CTR is what people might often see. So I like to look at that because now that I know that people are seeing that my videos exist, amazing, but they need to click on them, right? So that's like the next step. So I'll look at my click-through rate and I'll have a rough idea of what a good click-through rate is for my videos. and maybe what a low one is. And usually within 24 hours of me posting my video, I can see if there's a bit of a problem. - Right. What would you say is your like, Oh, this was a good click-through rate or an average click-through rate. - Anything above 5 for me is decent. - Right. - If I'm ever around the 3 mark specifically, between three and four, I'm like, Okay, this isn't working. I need to change the thumbnail. I need to change the title. Like something's not quite hitting. Sometimes though, it's the topic and I know that. So sometimes I'm like, no, it's fine. I just know that this isn't a topic that's going to be really popular yet and that's okay.
 But I do always look at the click-through rate, especially like within a few days of me posting, because that's usually the best time to make some changes. and to actually switch it up. So yeah, I'll look at the click-through rate and then once I know that people are clicking, great, that's like the next tick. And now I need to see like, are they watching though? 'Cause again, you can click on the video, but if you're clicking off straight away, then it's not gonna help. - Yeah. - So I'll look at the retention and I'll be like, okay, where are people dropping off? Are people staying for at least 50 of the video? Like, are there any key moments where people are like, nope, this isn't for me. And they're, you know, jumping ship and watching something else. Try not to take it personally. But I try to learn from it and just make sure that whatever mistake I made, I don't do it in my next video, for example. And then the rest of it is more to do with engagement. Do people comment afterwards? What's the likes like? Yeah, 100%. I know you mentioned just then, you sometimes change your thumbnails and your title. So do you do that after you've uploaded? I do sometimes, yeah. So I don't make a habit of it. No particular reason why, but it's just because it needs to be really tanking.
 like it needs to be again around that three percent mark for me to be like no switch the thumbnail and honestly deep down I think a lot of us know when the thumbnail is not very good. I think a lot of us are like you rushed that like you know I rushed that one I knew it wasn't gonna be great but sometimes you need the data to tell you. Yeah. You can just sit in our little la la land and be like it's fine we got it out and then be like oh actually. Yeah. You know I think um on you you mentioned something about um looking at the data and being honest with yourself and I think something that a lot of new creators run into is they're kind of afraid to look at the data because it can be something that is like, Oh, I have like mathematical evidence that I failed. And it's like, that can feel bad. But it's something that I think a lot of creators need to learn to get comfortable with. It's not like an emotional thing. It's just saying this was the impact of this decision. And there are changes you can make to improve it. I've had videos in the past where I decided to update the thumbnail of them. and they performed a lot better.
 Even videos that I was already happy with the performance, I was like, I think this could have a better thumbnail. Like, I did it for a five-year-old video. I just always thought that the thumbnail wasn't super great. I was like, What if I just change that? And then the views doubled within a few months of me updating that thumbnail. And I was like, Oh, okay. I don't make a habit of doing it all the time, even though I know it could work just because it can sometimes get a bit too much to be mentally like, yeah. - It's a bit distracting sometimes in the past. Sometimes you're like, let me just focus on the next video. - On the new stuff, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - But it is something to keep in mind. - That's so interesting. But yeah, I agree. It's difficult to look at the data sometimes because it's in such black and white that sometimes it can feel discouraging. But the more you look at it, the more you learn how to spot opportunities within it. And that's really where like your growth will often lie, you know? And sometimes you, I feel like it's important to know when certain videos aren't performing well, or maybe it's, you might notice that your channel goes in seasons.
 And this is something that I have only recently confirmed with myself, 'cause I waited three years to get three years worth of data before I decided actually my channel does go in seasons, 'cause I didn't wanna guess that it did and then be like, Oh, it's summer, I'm just gonna relax, if it wasn't the case. But after three years, I looked through my data, I'm like, No, In summertime, people don't actually want to hear me talk about entrepreneurship. They want to go out and have a holiday. And that is totally fair. Live your best life. But like, now I can actually see that. If I was avoiding the data and maybe I was just seeing the summary numbers, I could end up getting very I might even want to quit. Like if I was coming through summer months and I was like, what's happening? I might be like, it's over and quit without realizing that actually it's just a season thing. - So sort of talking about your channel in general, I'm curious to know why, when you launched your podcast, why did you launch it on a separate channel? Sort of like a channel that was brand new rather than your channel that you've uploaded on for such a long time. - So it was very much to do with the fact that I knew a big portion of my audience.
 I was quite in tune with how they consume content and how they wanna learn. And there were some who were like, just give me the answer. They're like, give me the answer quickly. They're the ones who love like my very quick intros or like no intro at all. They're like, I just want to learn and I want to learn quick. And I'll watch my videos at like 1.5 speed, which is wild to me because I already speak fast. I'm like, how are you consuming it? But those are the people who love like my main channel content and that's great. And I want to continue creating that for them. I also know there's another group of people who want the long form. They want to listen as they're doing the dishes and like walking around and they just want to slowly consume.

so youtube shorts is amazing for that because it really does a great job at pushing your content out to an audience who may not be aware of you and for me how it often works is if someone finds one of my shorts they'll often look at the rest of my content and then hopefully I can get them in with one of my longer videos and that's when I can like really hook them in. I know you talk about like evergreen content a lot as well that was the first time I'd actually heard that term. Oh really? Yeah so that's interesting that you make your content to last forever anyone can click on it at any time it's still relevant I guess that's that differs to my content as well because mine is more week by week this is relevant this week now we move on to the next week. Yeah that's so interesting because I And I guess with you, when you're looking at your view count and stuff, you can kind of tell the performance of a video within like weeks of it going live, because it's not necessarily going to pick up later. Whereas mine, like certain topics, when I talk about podcasting, I know that won't pick up straight away. But I know in six months time, it will have its moment. Like it's always with certain things. It's so interesting, isn't it? Yeah. I think they call it the long tail where it drops off, but it doesn't quite hit zero. And that tail actually makes up more than... that initial burst. Yeah yeah no stuff like that is always really cool and you're mentioning just earlier about you know Hannah she would have a very dedicated audience to her viewers because they're here to see you right

유튜브 채널 [youtube creator]
Search is often the thing that will give my videos the initial boost and then if people are landing on my videos and then watching a good chunk of it, it will often get picked up by YouTube's algorithm and that will help me get like, yeah, everything like browse features and suggested that's how I'll get traffic from there. But with search particularly, if you are creating content that solves a problem, especially, which is what my content very much does, then search is going to be incredible for you because people are literally going on to Google and YouTube asking a question that they need answered and need solved. So if you can do that in a way that's engaging and efficient and you can make sure that YouTube and Google understand what your video is about by using appropriate titles and all that kind of stuff, the result is that your video might appear. So, you know, like some people don't even realize that if people search for certain keywords on Google, like your YouTube video can appear. - Right. - Yeah. - So if you're really good at like answering specific questions or answering a need and you actually appear on Google or on YouTube and people are searching for that, it could do wonders for your channel.
Yeah, definitely. And I guess then that, creates new viewers they find you from that and then hopefully they become long-term viewers yes exactly that's great have you found that youtube shorts has brought in new viewers for you at all yeah and your podcast as well actually yeah yeah

유튜브 채널 [youtube creator]
 So obviously you mentioned that you look in your comments for inspiration. Are there any other features on YouTube that you find particularly useful? Yeah, so there's a new feature, which is the research tab on YouTube, which is really cool because it will literally tell you what your audience are watching and also the search terms that they're looking for as well. So it allows you to meet your audience where they're at because for a lot of us, even when you're quite niched down like I am, whilst one subject will be really, really popular one month, it might not be that popular in a couple months time.  so having that kind of insight could be incredible.  also google trends, i love Google Trends.  i've been using Google Trends for a long time.  back in like my marketing days, we used to use it a lot.
 And for anyone who's never used it before, it's essentially a website which allows you to see the popularity of certain search terms in Google over time. And you can filter it based on YouTube, based on location, based on time. So you can actually, back when I had my swimwear boutique back in the day, I used it a lot because I was like, When are people buying swimwear? So I would look at it and be like, Okay, this is the peak. People are shopping for swimwear around this month and blah, blah, blah. And this is how it's changed over the last four years. So from a creator's perspective, if there's a topic that you know is interesting for your audience, but you're not quite sure when, you think it might be slightly seasonal, you can enter that into Google Trends and it will show you like, okay, well, usually in July, people are looking for this type of information. So you just make sure you talk about it in July. Right, right. Would you say that for the nature of your content, search is one of the key ways that you are bringing new viewers in. Yeah, it is. It especially was in my early days as well and it still is now.

유튜브 채널 [youtube creator]
So, Jade, can you walk us through the process of coming up with an idea for your videos content ideas that, I don't know, 'cause obviously you've built a very strong community and your audience, you know what your audience wanna see. So how do you come up with the ideas? How do you know what they want to see and come up with them? - Yeah, so the first thing that I usually do is I default to what my audience are saying. So I'll spend time going through my comments. Like if I'm really stuck for ideas, I actually have a rolling list of ideas. So like there's always, I've probably got ideas for the next year. Like they're just there sitting there. - Wow, yes. - Whatever one I fancy, gets the most attention. But if I'm stuck, then I'll spend some time in my comments. And sometimes it's not just like in the comment section of my own content. If I know that my audience are hanging out elsewhere, then I'll have a look over there as well and see what they're saying, see what they're looking for. There's actually something you could do. I did this this morning and I was like, Oh, this is a good idea.
 where it's, let's say I'm watching another creator's content and maybe we're similar to each other, you can actually see where the key moments of retention are, you know, when you hover over the video. And I was hovering and I was like, Oh, that's so interesting. It seems like people really want to know about this specific thing. and then I filmed a video about it because I was like well clearly that's the thing that people are most interested in so that's another fresh tip that I just came up with yeah but yeah I spend a lot of time just trying to connect with my audience and figuring out what their kind of pain points are what questions they're asking. If I do like a long video where I'm covering multiple topics, that's usually a great space for me to get new ideas. Because if you go in the comments, people will be asking about one specific part. So you could do a video where you dive deeper into it. And then it's a nice little link and a nice little segue. That's really cool. You mentioned that you have this like backlog of Ideas for the next year. Where do you write your ideas down? Is it just simple notes or? - It's just in my notes. - Oh, right. - Yeah, my notes are absolutely wild, incredibly organized.
You would be shocked if you saw them. You'd be like, What is happening? - That's great. - It's like my equivalent of like my notebook. So I have like different notes for all my ideas. I have like separate notes for when I'm coming up with ideas whilst walking. And then, you know, when you like listen to podcasts, someone might be listening right now being like, I've got an idea. I then have a separate note for ideas whilst listening to podcasts and I write the podcast and everything. Oh, wow. - Wow. - But then you end up with this incredible idea bank that you can just utilize whenever you need it. I think it's really difficult to come up with creative ideas on the spot. And I think that's when people get a bit stressed. If you sit yourself down and you're like, okay, come up with an idea, whose brain works like that? It's so difficult to be creative on cue. Exactly. Creativity is something that comes in and out. And so if you have that bank, it can help to be a bit of an insulation against idea block, writer's block, all that stuff.

유튜브 채널 [youtube creator]
 and then another tip is titles and thumbnail, which I think are really, really important.  like I feel like we're quite good at like punchy titles on shorts.  yeah.  and I feel like that's really like helped us. People click and we're not, I wouldn't say we're like clickbaity. It's that blend of being excited but still relevant but not like... a boring title that you want to tell that someone's going to click but not be like untruthful yes when they click on the video they're not like oh yeah this isn't even about this yeah still keep it we just like hype up what's happening i guess in a title do you guys go for the capital letters we have now we're going through a phase we had this conversation yesterday because i'm going through the short speed and other people are like aren't doing it anymore and i'm like right are we behind like you go do you guys do capital letters and shorts every now and again i'll sort of like For example, I uploaded a short of an empty house tour. I think that was in capitals. The whole thing in capitals? Just empty house tour in capitals and then the rest of it not in capitals. So kind of a bit more casual.
 So it gets the attention more casual. Do you do emojis in it? In my long form video content, I do do emojis. What, your long form? Yeah, I do. Because we don't be the opposite. Yeah. Oh, really? Yeah, Nefertum and Longfall. What about you? For me, when it comes to titling videos, I try to just title it in a way where the viewers will be enticed and also have a good idea of what is actually going to happen in the video. So when it comes to capital letters, I'll do it if I think this word in particular is something that sticks out. I don't do the entire title in capitals because then I feel like, oh, maybe the whole sentence kind of becomes a bit less prominent. But if there's a word in particular, I'll make that capitals. And with emojis, I'll throw it in for a bit of fun. My approach to shorts is I actually just try and have fun with it. And so I titled a short yesterday, Paul, My Beloved, because there's a game where you have to keep a pet called Paul safe. And I unfortunately failed at that. I did that with a sad face emoji and a caterpillar in the title, just because I was having a bit of playful fun with it. And something I think is really interesting is you're mentioning the titles and thumbnails of shorts. I think some people don't prioritize that because of the fact that shorts appear in the feed and you don't, for the most part, you're not selecting into them. So why do you choose to prioritize them with that being the case? - I think for us it's 'cause like when we go for the analytics, there's like traffic on our channel. I think thumbnails then are important. and I think the title still shows up when you're scrolling so I feel like and I do read the titles I read and there must be someone else out there. Yeah I read them.

유튜브 채널 [youtube creator]
You know what, I have unlisted shorts before and then put them back and I think I'm actually curious about what made you want to delete some shorts because for me unlisting it was part of before YouTube had the nicely organized tabs for each type of content. It made my channel page, in my opinion, look a little messy. And that was just a personal, like, I want my channels to all look 16 by nine, not random verticals. But now that they have them, you know, organized in nice tabs, I just made all of them public again. What went into you thinking, oh, should I delete I think it was when we would put some of our content up and then it would go, you know in the analytics you can rate them out of 10 in terms of how well the watch time is and the views. And they were like 20. Yeah. They were like 20 out of 10. And we were like, oh, maybe we've just titled it wrong. or didn't pick the right thumbnail when you upload it on your phone on a short. - Yeah, when you analyze your content so much and you can rip it apart, I'm like, I shouldn't have started the video like that, or I shouldn't have done that, or I think that's what we were doing.
But then when you actually like take five minutes to put your phone down and then think about it, you're like, oh, it's fine, and then. Yeah, that kind of stops us from going through the deleting phase. So this one is a little bit savage. Okay. But if you're not going to watch your video, no one else is going to watch it. Agreed. And I think that's so like, I think if you're sitting for your video, especially when we edit our long form and I'm watching it, I'm like, God, I haven't shut up in like 10 minutes. Other people are going to think the same. I think we definitely do it with shorts. Yeah. We'll watch it back. And if we're at like 15 seconds and we're already like thinking of something else and we've like zoned out, it's like, well, everyone else is probably going to feel that vibe too. So yeah, I would say, yeah. So if you, would you watch it back and enjoy your own short? And if not, why? And even like write it down.  like I feel like when we write down what the problem is, we're like, oh, we need to add in a few more this and that's at the start and then it comes back.  yeah.  right.  yeah.

유튜브 채널 [youtube creator]
You could post like one day a week and that could be your, like Fridays could be your thing and that is you being consistent, making sure you're showing up every Friday and I feel like that's like a big, yeah that's a big tip. I think that's a good tip. Yeah and I think it's really key to like differentiate between frequency and consistency. Because you do get in blur don't you? Yeah, yeah you don't necessarily have to post every single day or every other day but as long as you're keeping a cadence that you can maintain Exactly. And I feel going on that, we've got some friends that want to, that are really into creating content and they like dabble in it. But then if they set in their mindset, right, I'm going to do Monday, Wednesday and Friday and then they miss like the Wednesday and then it's all out for like two months and then they kind of stop. And it's like, it's okay if you do miss a day. Yeah, definitely. That was Matthew Borderline passive growth on that one. But I kind of said, right? The next tip would just be, to not delete, just don't delete. I know that we sometimes go through our content and we're like should we just like hide that one?
Should we just take that one down? It doesn't look very good but then... Especially shorts. But you never know if that, when it will get picked up or if it will get picked up. I remember when we started shorts we were only maybe getting like a thousand views of shorts from, because we started shorts when it came out I think January 21 and I think we didn't actually see like any short success until the December And then all those other videos started picking up because obviously it was such a new thing and I feel like a lot of other people can relate to that too. People go back and watch your other shorts and before you know it they're in like a little bit of a loop. So I think just like... Just don't delete. Yeah, I bet you're glad you stuck with it and you just kept uploading them. You didn't sort of upload shorts for a month and think this isn't worth it. You've got to stick at it and then eventually it takes off. Have you ever deleted shorts? No. I haven't.

유튜브 채널 [youtube creator]
Yeah, no, I think, especially when experimenting with multi-format and going from long form to short form, there's this always fear of the views aren't working and how does it work with the channel and so forth. But what you have to realize is there's different audiences watching different formats that you're doing on your content. And by adapting and getting into different forms of multi-format, you're providing yourself with different mediums that your audience can engage with. So, for example, you're live streaming, you're entering podcasting, you have different videos such as your vlogs and your weekly vlogs and... The other videos that you do, they're all different mediums. So you should look at that, how you can utilize that in terms to grow your channel, but also attract a different audience. So essentially, it's not harmful, but you should strategize it in the way that benefits you and to build your audience and grow. And you wanted to say you had to debunk that myth, correct? Right. Yeah.
 I mean, that's why I started live streaming on my main channel, because I used to stream elsewhere and I created a separate channel for shorts and this and that. And I was like, let me just bring everything in one place. So if someone wants to find me, they only have to go to my channel to find it. Did anyone else here have any different approaches to that? No, for me, it was a bit like, I'm going to wait and see what happens with this. Cause I wasn't really one to jump. I haven't really jumped on the short form bandwagon. Um, but it is something that, especially now that you can link your shorts to a longer, a longer form video, it's something that I'm going to be looking at as kind of like a cross-promotional sort of thing. And then also, like you said, you know, it's different audiences. So maybe see if I can get some shorts viewers into watching the long form content. Yeah, definitely. And I'm exactly the same as Sam. That's exactly why I started uploading shorts is to link to my long form content, which is always my priority for me, the weekly vlogs. And then I cut down the intro, upload it as a short, connect it back to the long form to try and hook people in. Perfect.

유튜브 채널 [youtube creator]
Do hashtags and titles matter on shorts? And like, the explanation is a bit complex here, but it's simple. Like when we look at shorts, right? Shorts, most of the views come from the shorts feed. And most of the views come, like most of the attraction to shorts comes from the first three seconds. So like when you hook and when you captivate your audience. Everything else is kind of an additive.
So you're really focusing on the content here and how can you bring in your audience to watch it from the first three seconds, like the hook. After that, when you're watching it and when you're going into the data and the metadata regarding the video itself, you have to think about, okay, how can I improve the search and discovery? So that comes with titling, hashtags, descriptions, who you're tagging the video, the songs and so forth. So it really is, when you focus on that, it's more about the content rather than everything in between. Because the more you engage with your audience through the content, the more the video will appear more and it will be better for your channel.

유튜브 채널 [youtube creator]
So Sam, We've heard that you've started a podcast. I have, yeah. It's brand new. When I get back home, I'll be editing the first episode. But it was really just a question of, I kind of always wanted to do it. And then YouTube launched the podcast thing and I was like, oh, this is brilliant. Perfect. So it's a bit of an experimental thing, I suppose. Maybe this is too. It's just, I... Whenever I interview people on my channel, it never gets very good views, right? Because it's not really the same style that I normally do. So I figured, Okay, well, if I could have those interviews, put them together in a podcast, make a little series, And I'm just starting off with like, by doing it by season, right? So I thought, okay, I'll do like, I don't know, maybe six episodes, see how it goes. And if I hate it, I don't have to do any more. But I just thought it would be really cool. And it would be, you know, cool to like have a video podcast and then also be able to get that on the audio platforms as well.
But yeah, I think it's-- I like making content. I have a very small room that I film. There's not really room for an interview set up. But I really like-- I really like talking to people and getting some more stories on my channel, I think, is very important because, you know, I don't want anyone to think that I consider myself like the face of autism or anything like that. You know, there's so many more diverse stories of different people and, you know, I just, I want to... do something a bit more interesting that isn't just me the whole time. Yeah, I know what you mean. It's interesting to hear you say the face of autism actually. Is that kind of a responsibility that you weren't expecting? My responsibility is to give out accurate information, right, and not mislead. But like at the end of the day, you know, I have my experience and I can't really talk about other people's experiences which may be significantly different. Right.
So, um, you know, then it's a question of saying, like, Right, well, I've got my channel, but I can also do something now with the audience I have to talk about these different aspects, you know, like non-speaking autistic people or, you know, multiple disabilities or things like that. Or just people who've done really cool stuff and projects that I want to promote or apps or something, you know, it's really like... nice to be... It's a different way of being creative. It's not just about focusing on your own content, but it's about sort of saying, Okay, well, actually, what would be... What would be something really interesting for my audience to hear about that they might not know about? Yes, definitely. And with that responsibility, How do you deal with that? I mean, how do you... You say that a lot of people see you as an agony aunt. How do you kind of create that divide and that balance and sort of set your boundaries with your viewers? I have an email. I say this is for business inquiries only, right? Yeah. And so if they then send me an email... Sure, I'll read some of them.
But the expectation, from my perspective, has already been set, right? So then that gives me permission to say, Okay, sometimes I do reply to people's emails if it doesn't take too long and, you know, I have my own problems managing my email inbox. So it's not really something that I want to add to my load, but at the end of the day, I've already given that boundary. And as I've carried on and as the channel has grown, I've had to be more strict with myself more than anything. - Right. - So actually it's okay that you don't reply to these things. It's okay that you don't look at all the comments. It doesn't matter, you know? - I think it's a really, underspoken about thing that I especially see amongst creators who are just starting to develop their first audience. you want to be able to respond to everything, you want to be able to make every interaction with a viewer feel special.
 But at some point, it becomes a logistical thing where if I'm spending all this time responding to everything, I won't be able to continue creating the stuff that they actually are speaking about in the first place. And so it's something I encourage creators to do is to just actually take stock. What I actually have is a day on Fridays, I just go through all the messages, comments, I just look at everything. And then I will try to respond to things that I feel

유튜브 채널 [youtube creator]
 And when you started this channel, I'm getting the sense that you had a clear idea of what you wanted to do with it, what you wanted it to be like, perhaps from your experience of trying different types of videos in the past. So could you talk about when you actually started your channel, what was your strategy going into it? Yeah, I mean, I really love a good strategy. I'm a massive nerd about YouTube strategy, and we could really talk for a long time on that. So I started very strategically. I started with keyword research. So I was looking up, like, what are the search terms that people are looking for, and using those terms in the titles rather than maybe the words that I would choose. So I did start very, very strategically. But then, so at that time, it was a question of reply to every comment kind of situation, which I can't do anymore. You probably are long past this situation.
And that gave me a really good sense of what was hitting the mark with my audience or with my growing audience. But I think it's also really important that you can't keep going where you started from. So the strategies that worked for me when I had 100 subscribers are not the strategies that I would be using today. Oh, right. Could you describe maybe one of the differences between them? Well, I think when you are starting, you need to be-- this is my opinion, I think. You can do it a lot of different ways. But if you want to make a channel which has longevity, like you said, I think that the key is to focus on searchable content, stuff that people are still going to be interested in five or ten years from now. When you get to the point where I am, which I think is almost 200,000 subscribers, it's like I could... like I said before when we were chatting, I could make a video which just says, Drink coffee with me. And I just sit there and drink coffee, somebody would watch it. Right, right.
 So you have to be... Not that that's necessarily a great plan for my strategy at the moment, but you could make that video and it actually might do better than you think because people would click on it and go, What? Drink coffee with me? kind of thing. So you can then move to more of a... what do they call it, like ethical click bait. I guess so, yeah. I don't really do that sort of stuff. I tend to be pretty straight with my content, but like you can take advantage of that. Whereas when you're growing, you have to, I don't know if hustle's the right word, but like you've got to be a bit more strategic, I think. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, and you mentioned that when you first started, you looked for terms, you looked for the keywords. So what resources did you actually use when you were learning about how to grow your channel? I used a few plugins and things like that, which sort of give you good keywords. I think Google actually has a keyword discovery tool as well.
 So I kind of used a variety of things and then you learn about, you get a sense of like what are good keywords, right? So if I was trying to make a video that I wanted to rank highly on search, I wouldn't call it autism because I'd be competing against... - Everybody else. - Videos, right. But if I made something like symptoms of autism in women, that's like a very much more of a niche. And I'd probably, if I made that one right now, I'd probably rank really highly on search. Right, right. So what sort of keywords would you use if you were to make that video? So it would be like, so the keywords would be, it would be what they call a long, long... This is where I'm like, is this right? Long tail keywords. So autism, symptoms of autism in women would be like the keyword phrase. - Right, okay. - Yeah. - Yeah. - And then you'd have that in the title, the description, YouTube is quite sophisticated now. So they know, so I actually put keywords in my scripts sometimes. - Right, right. - As well.
 - 'Cause I guess like the transcript, everything is pulled from the video in order to match the best video to the viewer, right? So, you know, I think that's great. And one point you mentioned about the strategy for a newer creator compared to a more established one, I think it's really important to keep in mind because a lot of new creators starting out they want to make videos because they're looking at their favorite creators. And so they try to replicate what their favorite creators are doing, who maybe just upload a video simply called water or something, get a million views and they think I can do that too. But it doesn't quite work like that. You have to start somewhere where you can capture your first initial audience. And so I think that's why search is so often a great starting place for new creators, stuff like tutorials, you know, it's... - Reviews. - Exactly, as well. Like, what will someone be looking for where they can make an initial discovery of you? And then once you have your audience, you can branch out into other sorts of things.
 One of my first videos to do really well was called How to be a YouTube Gamer. And it wasn't a legitimate tutorial at all. The entire video was just me making fun of the culture of gaming on YouTube. But it did really well in part because people were genuinely searching for how to be a YouTube gamer. And they found the video and they found it funny, I hope. And that's how I got a little of an initial boost on my channel. - But that's like a really like OG YouTube type of video that does well. 'Cause I think, I remember like, this is showing my age, back when YouTube was very young and Jenna Marbles was like the thing, it was like how to do your makeup. Like that was one of the really, really, that was like the viral video of, you know, whatever year it was. And I think like that comedy kind of stuff was really like, a really big thing on YouTube back then. I don't know if it really is as much anymore, but certainly like that sort of taking the mickey out of satirizing other things. Yeah, absolutely. So I'm not surprised that one did well, to be honest.
 It's like really interesting. A lot of creators might think, oh, the sort of content I make doesn't really fit tutorial. And it's like, you can still find ways to have that kind of catchy title even if that's not the style of content you make. So I think that's a really great point that you brought up there. Yeah definitely and obviously over time you have built a community but I'm interested to know when did you first feel like you'd built that community? Let me think, so when I started out like I said it was very kind of strategy focused and I was doing a video a week pretty regularly I don't know how I managed it, but I was. And so it took me about six months to get to 1,000 subscribers. And I think it was around-- like I said, it was strategy. And I think it was around the 1,000 to 2,000 subscribed, but around that, that I was like, oh, I have a nice little community here.
 And that lasted for a couple of very-- that was a really sweet spot in terms of like, you could still reply to comments and people were discovering you. And then my channel kind of like one of the videos took off and... Do you remember which video that was? Yeah, it was the... Autism symptoms and girls video. Oh, right. Yeah. And it took off several months after I posted it. It did well when I posted it. And then it picked up just randomly one, you know, one December day. Right. And that was when the strategy... I don't know how many times I'm going to say strategy on this, by the way. You can say it as many times as you want. I'll say it more. But that was when the strategy side of it paid off because of the way that I had used functions, like using playlists on my channel to organize my stuff so people could binge watch my channel. So one video picks up, they go to the next video.
And some of my OG videos, I was even like, if you like this video, And then like the end screen kind of thing, which is really embarrassing to film. But it turns out that was quite effective. So yeah, like I kind of set that all in motion and then it just takes one video and it lifted the whole channel up quite quickly, which is exciting but terrifying at the same time. I don't know, did you guys ever have that, a big sort of viral moment? I definitely did myself. So I did describe the How to Be a YouTube Gamer video, but just prior to that video, I made an animation for KSI where I animated one of his story times and he actually shared that on his channel. And that gave me my first initial boost. I was celebrating 300 subscribers the day he did it. And then that boosted me to about 9,000.  so that's how I got my first initial audience.  and then with how to be a youtube game on top of that, I went to about 16,000.  i was like, Okay, something's going on here.
 i would say that for myself, it wasn't so much a viral video that made me feel like I had a community.  it was more when I started to see the same names in the comments again and again, and the same people coming back to watch each week.

And yeah, Hannah, I'd love to hear, like, how do you go about staying up to date with what's going on on YouTube? Yeah, definitely. I was actually going to say one of the exact features you mentioned in the analytics where you can see other channels that are similar to you and you can see what else your audience is enjoying watching. That's a big one that I look at quite a lot. But I feel like I'm just generally, I feel like I live and breathe YouTube. I feel like I'm always watching the kind of content that I enjoy creating. So I kind of like I think I naturally keep up to date with what people are doing. I make a lot of videos that are like what's out in the shops these days so I'll kind of like look at my subscription box a lot for inspiration and just generally picking up little nuggets of information from other people.

 And I know you kind of dabble in YouTube shorts. So can you talk us through your strategy and your approach to long form content versus shorts? I'm a long form guy. I've always been a long form guy because first of all, long form is like where you can grow the best connection with your audience. I think when Shorts was launched, I was kind of like very skeptical about it because I'm like, you know, like it's like YouTube is like, it's meant to be like, you know, like we have, we are meant to put long form videos so that we're going, you know, have that connection and spend more time with the audience. But I think recently, I've started testing out Shorts. I think I had one of my first Shorts get like 2 million views four months ago. And I kind of like saw the fact that, okay, what it did, because now YouTube has this new feature that allows you to attach a long form video to the Shorts. So when the shots did well, I picked a shot
 I did a video on Namibia and then I did a shot on Namibia and then I kind of like attached my long-form Namibia video to it. So I noticed that the day when the shot did well, I got some views from the shots. And the shots also made money, interestingly. It made some money. It wasn't as much as... It wasn't a lot. It was very small. But it made money and it also made people watch the long-form videos. So nowadays, I'm... I'm trying to be very strategic about it. So if I make a long form video, I want to make like a shot that is related to that long form video. So that's kind of my strategy with shots at the moment. That's what I'm doing now. I totally agree with that. I do think that with shorts, they are a good entry point for viewers who maybe are not willing to commit to a full length video yet. And so if you can put out a short, it's okay. You know, if you want to watch this and then you're intrigued enough, maybe you'll watch the long form thing. But I definitely agree, like long form. And I know for Hannah as well, it's just our bread and butter, isn't it?
So we definitely love prioritizing those two. Yeah. Yeah, but I do also think when long form is your bread and butter, so easy to make a short from your long form content because you've got the footage. You can just edit it in a different way. And then that means you can appeal to viewers who prefer shorts and viewers who prefer long form. It's kind of like best of both worlds. Everyone keeps telling me on this podcast I need to be posting more shorts and I really need to take the advice. on the topic of content strategy and knowing, having a really strategic view of how we go about making our content. With your content, obviously it's travel related. So there is a lot of planning that has to go in, not just for making the video, but also getting to the different countries you travel to. I want to know how what is your process of planning a video?

When did you first realize you had a reach beyond just YouTube? Nigeria or beyond just the UK, the US. When did you realize you had an international audience?
 I think at the beginning when I realized it was my audience was kind of like i had more because i used to look at the analytics i realized oh i had a lot of people from the us from the uk watching for me it was just more like okay when i saw that i was like if they if they are interested in watching what i'm making now that means if i traveled there they would also probably be interested in watching it so um i i would say that it was Meeting people, seeing them when I travel, that made me decide to go there. Because I've always wanted to have an international audience. I've always wanted to make videos that anybody that goes to the world can watch. Because I thought about the fact that all the people I was learning how to make videos from, like the KC Nightclub, I've never met them before. but I'm watching their videos and I'm in Lagos, Nigeria. So that means I can also make my own videos wherever I am in the world and anybody across the world can also watch it.
 So the whole point of like expanding and traveling out there has always been something that I've always wanted to do. And secondly, when I started to understand analytics and CPM, I realized that the international audience, the CPM and you know, CPM is cost per meal is how much you make by 1000 views for a lot of people who are watching. I realized that, um, If you have an international audience, you make more money. So I started to kind of like pivot my content recently from last year, like within last year and this year now to appeal more to like the international audience. So, yeah. Right. What I'm just curious, like on that note, what sort of strategies are you employing to nurture that international audience more or what are you thinking of using anyway?
 Yeah, so one of the things I've realized and I've started doing is just one it's like okay who do I want to appeal to and what are they interested in and you know kind of like having like my audience profile like what does that what does my audience look like my major audience I realize my major audience like the people who watch me the most are people in my age group who are interested in traveling the world and seeing places and And if I think about it, when I think about it, I'm like, okay, checking my traffic, where is most of my audience coming from? What are the sorts of content that would appeal to them? Also, another one is also looking at a lot of like the YouTubers in America, like, okay, where are they going to? How can I make this video that they made, but in my own way?
 how can I share my own perspective even though I'm an African discovering the world but you know maybe a lot of like guys in Canada or guys in the US have made videos about a specific country I can go there and also make my own video and share my own you know like perspective because the fact that a lot of people watch that video from America that means if I make my own they'll probably see it too so those are some of the strategies I think one I also did recently with the Caribbean was like I realized that most of the people who travel to the Caribbean yeah mostly from America So that was why I went there to make videos like the Bahamas video. I also wanted to visit Bahamas though, but the main idea behind it was like, okay, to get more of that international audience. And eventually like looking at the analytics after dropping the video, I realized that like, Over 40 something percent of people watch that video. They are all from America. It sounds like you've taken a lot of inspiration from other YouTubers, other creators internationally. And I know that you've also collaborated with them.
 I'd love to hear your thoughts on general collaboration. Have you found that it's helped you build your audience? Has it helped the people you've collaborated with to build their audience? So, yeah, well... It's very complicated because sometimes I've collaborated with, you know, when I was starting out, I used to feel like if you just had a collaboration with like one big YouTuber, you know, you just blow up and then you just have all these subscribers. But gradually, as I've gotten to do it over time, I realized that sometimes, you know, it doesn't really do much. And collaborations, collaboration is good.
 depending on who you decide to pick and depending on how it is done because i've done collaborations with people before and how it was done it wasn't done in a way where it's like kind of like mutual so you have to figure out who the person is what kind of content it is you know does it does it align with the person's audience because imagine me i'm a travel i'm a travel channel and i'm doing if i did a collaboration with debbie a cooking channel so if travel and cooking is still kind of like related but it's like it has to be kind of like similar or maybe like a business channel now and I'm travel if it's if it's too far apart or a gaming channel imagine like I'm a travel creator and I did a collaboration on the gaming channel it won't it won't really it won't work we find a way to make it work don't worry we find a way but yeah it's in this chat I definitely understand what you mean. It's super important that the audience that you're trying to mesh are audiences that share similar interests.
That's definitely something I, a misconception I had when I was younger was all you need is one big shout out or one big collaboration and then every person in that audience will come to you. And then when you think about it, it's like, wait a minute, when the creators I've watched have done a video of someone else, the only time I've gone to check out that person's channel is when that person had content I was interested in, because I'm interested in the creator I'm already watching. And so I think that's something that's really important. for creators to consider is that, wait a minute, is there an audience synergy here? Is there something that this creator can offer my audience? Not just me as a creator, but can they offer something to my audience? Because that's how they're going to grow. So absolutely, I think that's a terrific point to bring up. Yeah, definitely. I think audience is so important. Like, obviously, we focus a lot on creating the content and it can get kind of swept up in you, your videos, you put it out there.

 So every time we put something out, we look at how it's doing. Personally, I'll go in there and I'll see in terms of growth, how, how, how is it growing as a video? Again, the retention time, how long are people actually watching this video? And so, but I also, I'm also subscribed to a lot of content creators that actually sort of do research on what the algorithm is doing. And so they'll be in, they'll sort of announce whenever there's an announcement, because I don't know where these announcements happen, but I follow a lot of creators who will say they've, started doing this and they've started doing this and then I'll tell them, I'll say, hey, Mr. Beast says. And then she'll be like, okay, cool, let's do it. Because our goal, like I said, because we do podcasts, it also makes us quite versatile in how we can put out our content.
Because you have an hour, 30 minutes of footage, you can go either way. You can find really catchy hooks, in the content, or you can go in depth with it. And it's just about where the platform is at that point, what's working, what's everyone else doing, and sort of slotting in your content and your perspective to suit that. But yeah, it's about having your ear on the ground and seeing what other creators are doing. How are they... How are they innovating in terms of putting out their content? And when you see that, you look at how it's working and how their page is growing, and then you try and implement that into your own page. For sure, for sure. I think one thing that's super important as a creator is actually watching content. So you can have an idea of what's going on on the platform, you know, so it is very useful that you do look at a lot of content so that you're in the loop with that.
 No, definitely. Yeah, something that I found really interesting in one of our previous conversations, actually, Brendan, was when you said that you watch kind of like US or UK creators to see what trends are coming up. And then obviously, because you guys are based in South Africa, you use those trends to your advantage. You may be sort of like even a year down the line, you can kind of predict what's coming up. So can you tell us a little bit about that research? Because I think other people listening to this podcast would find that so interesting. Yeah. Yeah, so we realized like a few years ago that everything sort of starts in the northern hemisphere and then falls down, especially technologically. So whenever there is beta programs, we don't have access to them. but we know they're there because we are on the platform. So we see it. And so being plugged into what's happening in the UK and in the US, it kind of really helps for us because we can see where everything is moving towards.
 And, and, And a lot of the content creators will share it and they'll say, this is what's happening. This is what we're doing. And so whenever that happens, we then just kind of get ready and prepare ourselves, put ourselves in a position for whenever that feature is unlocked here, we can then take advantage of it. In fact, it's not just in content. It's actually just in everything. Right, it's really interesting how you've been able to turn what some could perceive as a disadvantage, having to wait to get access to features, into an advantage because it gives you foresight. You can see maybe what mistakes others are making and make sure to avoid those, and you can see what things others are doing really well, and you can make a plan of how to implement them into your own plans. You know, even on your channel, Mvumi, you make use of so many of YouTube's features, you know, it would seem that you just had it locked in from the beginning. We're going to make use of memberships. We're going to make use of, you know, joining a partner program. We're going to do all this thing.
 But obviously, as of every creator, it's a gradual thing over time. Could you tell us a bit about the journey of like unlocking features of YouTube and actually using them to their advantage? Yeah. I think it goes back to what Brendan's sharing. Watching other creators that we look up to that inspires us is very interesting. And we're researchers, even though we research in different ways, but we're researchers. And once you get into things, because another thing with a lot of creatives is we get stuck in the research and then we don't implement. And then we're just stuck with a whole lot of information and nothing's happening. So for us…

Not sure which thumbnail to use? Try Test and Compare, a feature that lets you choose up to three video thumbnails to test with viewers to help pick your winner. Here's how it works Eligible creators can use the Test Compare feature through YouTube Studio Desktop when publishing a new video or with an existing video. On the Video Details page, go to Thumbnail. From the options, select Test Compare. From here, you can upload up to three images to learn which one viewers prefer. Then click Done. Testing is only available for public, long-form videos, and the test will start once you publish your video. Here's how the test works. YouTube will show your chosen thumbnails evenly across your video's audience and will select a winning thumbnail based on which one generates the most watch time share.
 You can check the status of your test at any time by going to the video details page and clicking view test report. From here, you'll see how much time is left for the test and how they're performing. You can also choose to stop the test and manually set one of the thumbnails as the winner. If you let the test run, the results may take a few hours or up to a couple weeks to be finalized. How long it takes to get the result is affected by factors like how similar your thumbnails are. The more they differ, the more likely your test will finish faster. And your video traffic. The more thumbnail impressions that your video receives, the faster your test will finish. Once the test is finished, the test report will show the results. If there's a statistically significant result, you'll see a winner label. YouTube will automatically update your video thumbnail to this winner when the test is done.
 You might also see a preferred label, which means the results were not statistically significant, but there was a thumbnail that performed slightly better. If there's no clear winner, The first thumbnail will be selected and shown to your audience. Remember that in either case it's ultimately up to you. You can always manually select the video thumbnail you want to use. You can also choose to run a new test but note it will delete your old experiment. Let's walk through some things to note and best practices for using the test and compare feature. Thumbnails must follow our community guidelines and the tool will not work on videos that are designated as made for kids, for mature audiences, or live. Note that great thumbnails serve an important purpose beyond getting viewers to click. They help a viewer understand what the video is about so that they don't waste their time clicking on the wrong videos.
 We suggest testing thumbnails on a limited selection of older videos for initial guidance, then a selection of more recent videos you think will provide the most meaningful insights for your content strategy. We also recommend testing thumbnail variations that explore different layout compositions and changes to thumbnail elements, including background, text overlays, and object placement to learn which resonates most with your audience. Some tips to keep in mind Ensure your images are balanced, with a focal point to direct viewers' attention towards. Utilize high contrast, allowing your subject to stand out against the background in both light and dark mode. If there's a face in your thumbnail, consider emotion. Be expressive and consider how you want viewers to feel when seeing your thumbnail.
 With text, remember that fewer words can be impactful, while too much text can be difficult to process while scrolling. And finally, when it comes to depth of field, keep your background in mind and play with blank space. We hope the test and compare feature will help you gain insights when it comes to making thumbnails and help your overall video performance in the long run. For more info, check out the links below.

Promotions on YouTube let you set up ad campaigns for your content. On top of regular channel growth and organic discovery, promotions can get your videos and shorts in front of new audiences, helping you and your business reach your goals. Let's walk through what promotions are, who might use them, and how to use them. First, what are promotions on YouTube? Promotions let you run your video or short as an ad on YouTube. Your ad can appear in YouTube search results, the home feed, the shorts feed, watch next, or as an ad on other videos on the watch page. Based on goals and criteria you select, YouTube will automatically show your promoted content to viewers who are likely to engage with your channel. Content you promote will be labeled as sponsored. Who might use promotions? Any creator can use promotions. You don't need to be part of the YouTube Partner Program to use them. However, you should have a clear goal in mind when using them.
 Creators use promotions to grow their business or to help get their content in front of new audiences. Promotions can help increase sales by driving additional views to your content that showcases your products or services. Direct viewers to a specific site to buy your merch, products, concert tickets, courses, or more. Or reach a specific audience, like viewers in a new country. Remember, promotions should be used in addition to your channel's organic reach and discovery on YouTube. Also note that any subscribers or watch time gained from promotions spending won't count towards YouTube Partner Program eligibility. Next, how do you use promotions? You can easily set up a promotion for your content from your phone or a desktop. You can do this using the Promote button from your content's watch page. or from your content list by tapping the three-dot menu, then Promote. From Desktop, you can also go to YouTube Studio, then Content, then Promotions, then New Promotion.
 You'll be asked to link your Google Ads account or set up a new one to use promotions. You'll see four main steps when setting up a promotion Goal, Video, Targeting, and Budget. At the Goal step, you'll see the option for audience growth, video views, or website clicks. At the video step, you can add or change the content you want to promote and edit the promotion headline or description. If you chose Website clicks as your goal, you'll also see the option to enter the landing page where you want to send viewers. At the targeting step, you can choose the locations of the viewers you want to reach. And at the budget step, you can choose the budget amount and duration for your promotion. Keep in mind that to be eligible for a promotion, your content must be public or unlisted and at least 10 seconds long. It also needs to meet Google's video ad requirements and Google's editorial advertising policy. Once your promotion is approved and running, you can keep track of metrics like impressions, views, and subscribers.
 You can also make edits while it's running. Finally, let's walk through some questions you may have about promotions. Do I need to promote my content to become a successful channel? Absolutely not. We want to give creators more options to reach new audiences and share their businesses, so we are offering this as an additional lever to help meet your goals. Creators of all sizes can be successful relying on our organic recommendations and a strong content strategy to grow their channel at no cost. Promoting your content is handled separately from our organic systems. Channels and creators can thrive with or without promoting their content. If you do choose to use promotions, there's never any minimum spend and you can stop at any time. What are the best practices for running a promotion and getting the best performance? We recommend running your promotion for at least a week, and keep in mind the targeting choices you make will impact the cost per action for your promotion.
 For example, views in a certain country may cost less than in another country, so make sure you're intentional with your targeting, and you select the options that are important and relevant to your channel. Do promotions hurt the organic reach of my channel or my other videos' performance? No, promotions don't impact the organic performance of your channel or of the promoted content. It's true that promoted content will generally see a drop in aggregated metrics, like audience retention and click-through rate in YouTube Analytics, which is any time there is an increase in reach, whether through promotions or organically. That said, promotions will not impact the way your content is recommended in typical search and discovery on YouTube. Organic recommendations focus on learning how content performs when it is recommended, not when it's run as an ad promotion. To take a closer look, you can always use YouTube Analytics to split out audience retention by organic and paid traffic. Are the subscribers from promotions real?
 Yes! We only count organic subscribers towards YouTube Partner Program eligibility to help keep an equal playing field for everyone interested in joining the program. But subscribers gained from promotions are still subscribers. They can receive notifications about your new content, and they can become robust members of your community. A promotion may kickstart a viewer's relationship with your channel. And if you continue to provide content that's interesting and valuable to them, there are plenty of ways for them to engage once they're aware of you. Right from YouTube, it's simple to use promotions to meet your business and growth goals. If promotions are the right fit for you, try them out. And thanks for watching.

You can add up to four elements to your end screen, and you can edit both the timing and the placement of your end screen elements. To edit the timing, drag and drop the blue bar in the timeline to set where you want the end screen to show, or you can enter a specific timecode. To edit the placement, use the Preview video player to drag and drop the element. The preview window will show you how the elements will show against your video, so you can check and ensure nothing is interfering with important visuals in your video. You can also click the grid icon to decide if you want the preview player to show a grid over the video preview, snap to grid, and snap to element for help with placing your elements. If you change your mind about what you added, you can use undo, redo, or the trash icon to make edits or delete the element. Once you're done adding and editing your end screen elements, click save.
