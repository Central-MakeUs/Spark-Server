As a creator, how can I make videos that are noticeable and make viewers keep watching them? I will introduce some things to be careful about when making successful videos on YouTube. To make videos that are easy to find and more appealing to viewers, the image, title, and explanation of previews must be interesting and accurate. The information provided in the preview image, title, and description will not only help you recommend videos on the YouTube system, but also tell viewers why they should watch the video. When adding the information, follow the YouTube Community Guide. To create a video of a high level, use the card and the final screen. This feature will help you increase your viewing time and channel participation. The card is displayed at the top right of the video to encourage viewers to watch more of your content.
 The final screen is displayed at the end of the video, and you can add more videos, view or subscribe to the play list for viewers. Both functions can be added during the upload process. If there are multiple videos on the channel, you can use the Playlist and Channel Section. If you use the Playlist, you can group multiple videos so that viewers can watch your videos in a row. It will help you increase the viewing time of the channel, which is an important measurement item on YouTube. You can group videos as you want, not only the topic and form. If you have a playlist, you can add it to the channel homepage as a section. In the section, you can set the layout of the channel homepage. The section is composed of a video and playlist, and it is useful for organizing and showing content made for channel visitors.
 If you go to the YouTube Studio's custom settings page, you can add a section. The most important element to succeed on YouTube is to remember that it's content made by yourself. You don't have to be perfect. Make videos based on your favorite topics. Viewers are waiting. Thank you for watching.

썸네일 및 제목팁
시청자에게 동영상이 무엇에 대한 것인지 어떻게 알릴 수 있을까요? 일반적으로 시청자는 썸네일과 제목을 먼저 확인합니다. 이러한 정보는 동영상의 내용을 간략하게 소개하고 시청자가 시청 여부를 결정하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 흥미로운 사실은 실적이 우수한 동영상의 90%가 맞춤 썸네일을 사용한다는 점입니다.
눈에 띄는 썸네일 디자인
동영상 타겟층이 누구인가요? 구독자를 타겟팅하는 콘텐츠라면 친한 친구처럼 친숙한 기능을 강조해 보세요. 일반 시청자를 타겟팅하는 콘텐츠라면 누구나 공감할 수 있는 행동과 감정에 초점을 맞춰 보세요. 예를 들면 놀란 얼굴 표정을 썸네일에 사용해 보세요.
'3분할 법칙'을 적용하여 흥미로운 이미지를 만들 수 있습니다. 그런 다음 이미지에 브랜딩 및 설명 텍스트를 오버레이하세요. 문구를 추가할 때는 읽기 편한 글꼴을 사용하세요.
디자인은 너무 복잡하게 만들지 마세요. 색상과 구성을 역동적으로 사용하면 시선을 끌 수 있지만 지나치면 오히려 독이 될 수 있습니다.
썸네일은 기기마다 다르게 표시되므로 썸네일 이미지를 가능한 한 크게 만드세요.
시청자마다 취향이 다르고 썸네일 스타일은 시간이 지남에 따라 변할 수 있습니다. 내 커뮤니티에서 효과가 있는 방법을 지속적으로 파악하는 것이 중요합니다. 신규 시청자의 관심을 끌 수 있도록 예전 썸네일을 트렌드에 맞게 바꿔 보는 것도 좋습니다.
제목 작성 방법
정확성을 추구하세요. 제목이 동영상 내용을 정확하게 반영해야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면 시청자가 시청을 중단할 수도 있고 내 동영상의 발견 가능성에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다.
간결하게 작성하세요. 시청자가 제목의 일부만 볼 수도 있습니다. 최대한 짧게 작성하되 가장 중요한 단어를 앞쪽에 배치하는 것이 좋습니다. 에피소드 번호와 브랜드는 뒤에 배치하세요.
과도한 대문자 및 이모티콘 사용을 삼가세요. 감정이나 동영상의 특별한 요소를 강조하고자 할 때 신중하게 사용하세요. 예: '우리 아이들이 로봇을 만들었어요!!!!!"
동영상 제목 유형
다음과 같은 방법으로 시청자의 관심을 유도할 수 있습니다.
예상 콘텐츠를 명확하게 설명하는 검색 가능한 제목을 통해 비슷한 콘텐츠를 검색하는 시청자에게 쉽게 도달할 수 있습니다.
특정 주제의 콘텐츠를 찾고 있지 않은 시청자에게도 호기심을 자극하고 관심을 유도할 수 있는 흥미로운 제목을 사용합니다.

데이터 세부 분석
아이디어를 더 얻고 싶다면 YouTube 분석의 조사 통계를 사용하여 내 시청자층 및 YouTube 전반의 시청자가 YouTube에서 무엇을 검색하는지 알아볼 수 있습니다.
YouTube 분석의 시청자층 탭에서 내 시청자가 본 다른 동영상들을 확인하여 썸네일과 제목에 대한 아이디어도 얻을 수 있습니다.
다음 측정항목을 사용하여 각 시청자층에 내 썸네일과 제목이 얼마나 효과적이었는지를 살펴보세요.
모든 연령대의 경우 게시 후 첫 24시간 동안 홈 및 추천에서 발생한 클릭률(CTR)을 확인합니다. 이 수치는 평균 노출수(IMP)가 넘는 동영상에서 확인하세요. 홈 및 추천은 시청자가 새 동영상과 채널을 자주 탐색하는 곳입니다.
구독자의 경우 게시 후 24시간 동안 구독 피드에서 발생한 클릭률(CTR)을 확인합니다. 구독자는 플랫폼의 다른 곳에서 내 동영상을 볼 수도 있지만 구독 피드는 가장 참여도가 높은 팬을 반영합니다.
권장 조치
썸네일을 검토하여 내 동영상의 매력을 잘 나타내는지 확인해 보세요. 썸네일 정책도 준수해야 합니다.
촬영 중에 사진을 찍으면 동영상을 업로드할 때 여러 가지 썸네일 옵션을 사용할 수 있습니다.
누가 내 동영상을 볼지, 어떤 위치에서 찾을지를 생각해 보고 검색 가능한 제목과 흥미로운 제목 중에서 선택하세요.
동영상을 게시한 후에는 YouTube 분석에서 측정항목을 확인하여 썸네일의 제목과 효과를 측정하는 것도 잊지 마세요.

동영상 설명을 위한 팁
YouTube는 세계 최대 규모 수준의 검색엔진입니다. 키워드를 잘 활용해 설명을 작성하면 시청자들이 검색을 통해 동영상을 더 쉽게 찾을 수 있습니다.
설명 작성
설명은 YouTube 알고리즘 및 시청자에게 동영상의 내용을 알려줍니다. 설명은 두 부분으로 나누어 생각할 수 있습니다. 첫 번째는 시청자가 데스크톱이나 휴대기기에서 '더보기'를 클릭하기 전에 보게 되는 내용이고 두 번째는 클릭한 후에 보게 되는 내용입니다. 시청자는 설명의 처음 몇 줄부터 보게 되므로, 이 부분에 동영상 설명을 넣는 것이 좋습니다.
설명의 두 번째 부분에는 시청자가 자세히 알아볼 수 있도록 채널에 대한 기타 정보를 추가할 수 있습니다. 업로드되는 모든 동영상에 기본 채널 정보를 추가하는 기본 설명을 만들 수도 있습니다. 설명에는 최대 5,000자가 허용됩니다.
동영상마다 고유한 설명을 작성하세요. 그러면 시청자가 검색을 통해 동영상을 찾기 쉬워지고, 다른 비슷한 동영상 사이에서 더 눈에 띄게 됩니다.
동영상의 내용을 나타내는 주요 단어 1~2개를 찾아, 설명과 제목을 작성할 때 그 단어를 눈에 띄게 사용합니다. YouTube 분석 및 Google Ads 키워드 플래너의 조사 탭을 사용하여 인기 키워드와 그 동의어를 파악하세요. 이러한 단어를 포함하면 검색으로 발생하는 트래픽을 극대화할 수 있습니다.

설명 맞춤설정
설명 입력란에는 텍스트만 표시할 수 있지만 형식을 지정할 수는 있습니다. 텍스트를 굵게 또는 기울임꼴로 표시하거나 텍스트에 취소선을 적용할 수 있습니다.
휴대기기에서는 서식을 지정하려는 텍스트를 강조 표시하여 수정 바를 연 다음 서식 지정 옵션을 선택할 수 있습니다. 설명에 글머리기호 목록을 추가하려면 줄의 시작 부분에 '*,' '+,' 또는 '-'를 입력하고 공백을 넣으세요. 컴퓨터에서는 맨 아래 옵션을 사용하여 설명란에서 바로 텍스트 서식을 지정할 수 있습니다.
대화형 요소를 추가해서 조회수를 높이고, 공동작업을 소개하고, 구독자 기반을 확대할 수 있습니다.
동영상이 길 경우 동영상 챕터를 사용해 시청자가 중요한 부분으로 건너뛸 수 있도록 합니다.
관련 동영상의 재생목록으로 연결되는 링크를 제공합니다.
공동작업을 소개하면서 도움을 준 채널과 사람들을 멘션합니다.
시청자에게 중요한 링크를 표시하려면 채널 프로필 링크를 추가하세요.
데이터 세부 분석하기
동영상이 YouTube 검색결과에 나타나게 하려면 어떻게 해야 할까요? YouTube 분석에서 '시청자가 내 콘텐츠를 발견한 방법' 보고서를 확인하여 콘텐츠 도달범위 및 참여도를 확인합니다. 설명에 이러한 단어가 누락되어 있나요? 내 동영상을 직접 검색으로 찾는다고 가정해 보세요. 검색창에 어떤 단어를 입력할까요? 설명에 이러한 단어를 포함하면 시청자가 내 콘텐츠를 더 쉽게 찾을 수 있습니다.
분석에 있는 '시청자가 내 콘텐츠를 찾는 방법' 보고서는 시청자가 내 콘텐츠를 찾을 때 가장 많이 사용하는 검색어를 보여줍니다.
권장사항
기본 설명 입력란을 작성하면 모든 동영상에 자동으로 추가 정보를 표시할 수 있습니다.
YouTube 검색, 동영상 보기 페이지, 다양한 휴대기기에서 동영상 설명이 어떻게 표시되는지 확인하세요. 가장 중요한 정보가 원하는 대로 표시되나요?

검색 및 탐색 팁
YouTube는 각 시청자별로 즐길 가능성이 가장 큰 동영상을 소개합니다. YouTube의 검색 및 탐색 시스템은 시청자 개개의 다양한 관심사에 맞는 동영상을 찾습니다. YouTube의 목표는 사람들이 좋아하는 동영상을 더 많이 보게 하여 YouTube를 꾸준히 방문하도록 유도하는 것입니다.
YouTube 시스템은 어떤 동영상을 선호하나요?
YouTube 시스템은 크리에이터가 제작하는 동영상의 유형에 대해 특정한 의견을 갖지 않으며 특정 형식을 선호하지도 않습니다. 동영상 순위는 실적과 시청자 맞춤설정(시청 및 검색 기록 포함)에 따라 정해집니다.
YouTube는 시청자별로 맞춤 동영상을 어떻게 추천하나요?
YouTube는 시청자의 다양한 신호에 따라 다음 정보를 파악하여 동영상을 추천합니다.
시청자가 과거에 시청한 동영상: 시스템은 이 정보를 통해 시청자가 좋아할 만한 동영상을 표시할 수 있습니다.
주로 함께 시청하는 동영상: 시스템은 시청자가 시청할 가능성은 높지만 아직 노출되지 않은 동영상을 파악할 수 있습니다.
사용자가 특정 채널 또는 주제를 시청하는 비율: 시스템은 이를 통해 시청자에게 추천할 콘텐츠를 파악할 수 있습니다.

YouTube 시스템은 동영상 실적을 어떻게 확인하나요?
YouTube 시스템은 동영상이 시청자에게 추천될 때 동영상의 실적을 확인합니다. 예를 들어 동영상이 시청자에게 추천될 때 시청자가 동영상을 시청하는지, 무시하는지, 아니면 '관심 없음'을 클릭하는지를 확인한 후 시청자가 다른 동영상으로 이동하지 않고 머물고 있는지를 살펴봅니다. 시스템은 평균 시청 지속 시간 및 평균 시청 비율(%)을 순위 결정에 필요한 신호로 사용합니다. 마지막으로 좋아요/싫어요 및 시청 후 설문조사 결과를 사용하여 시청자가 해당 동영상을 좋아했는지 확인합니다.
내 동영상의 시청자 수에 영향을 주는 외부 요인은 무엇인가요?
시청자는 세 가지 주요 요소를 통해 유입됩니다.
주제 관심도
주제 관심도는 특정 주제에 대해 얼마나 많은 전 세계 사용자가 관심을 보이고 동영상을 시청하는지를 보여줍니다.
다른 주제보다 광범위한 관심을 끄는 주제도 있지만 관심의 정도는 시간이 지나면서 변할 수 있습니다.
경쟁
YouTube 시스템은 시청자가 시청할 수 있는 모든 채널의 동영상에 순위를 매깁니다.
내 동영상의 측정항목이 양호하더라도 다른 채널 동영상의 실적이 훨씬 더 높으면 노출수가 낮아질 수 있습니다.
성수기
YouTube 트래픽은 연중 시기별로 달라질 수 있습니다.
시청자의 거주 국가 또는 일상의 상황 등을 생각해 보고 주요 연휴 동안의 시청률 변동을 예상해보세요.
동영상이 추천되는 방식에 영향을 미치는 요소는 무엇인가요?
YouTube 시스템은 시청자의 시청 기록, 동영상 실적 및 참여도 측정항목, 궁극적으로는 시청자가 동영상에 도달하는 데 도움을 주는 외부 요소의 영향을 받습니다.
권장사항
시청자가 좋아하는 콘텐츠에 집중하세요. 그렇게 해서 사용자가 동영상을 본다면 맞춤 콘텐츠도 결국 따라가기 때문입니다.
시청자가 어떤 동영상을 가장 좋아하는지 자문해 보세요. 시청자는 내 채널을 얼마나 자주 시청하고 싶어 할까요? 이러한 질문에 대한 도움을 받으려면 내 시청자층을 파악해야 합니다.

신규 시청자 및 재방문 시청자 팁
YouTube 분석의 시청자층 탭에서 시청자 기반에 대해 자세히 살펴볼 수 있습니다. 관련 차트에서 시청자가 누구이고, 내 채널에 얼마나 자주 방문하며, 어디에서 유입되는지를 확인할 수 있습니다. 시청자를 알면 참여도가 높은 시청자를 위한 콘텐츠 전략을 계획하는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다.
재방문 시청자
시청자층 탭의 신규 시청자 및 재방문 시청자 데이터는 커뮤니티의 성장에 관한 유용한 정보를 수집할 때 중요합니다.
재방문 시청자: 이전에 내 채널을 시청했으며 추가 시청을 위해 다시 방문한 시청자를 말합니다. 신규 시청자보다 재방문 시청자 수가 많다면 다음에 해당할 가능성이 높습니다.
비슷한 형식이나 주제를 게시하거나 동일한 진행자와 꾸준히 작업합니다.
시청자가 계속 채널을 방문한다는 점을 감안하여 동영상 간의 시청률을 안정적으로 유지합니다.
신규 시청자를 확보하기 위한 아이디어:
콘텐츠 실험을 통해 더 폭넓은 시청자층의 관심을 유도해 보세요. 관심 있는 주제에 대한 새로운 동영상과 더 많은 사용자에게 도달할 수 있도록 고안된 동영상을 활용하면 정규 프로그램에 새로운 시청자를 확보하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 예를 들어 라이프스타일 크리에이터는 패션 위크에 대한 브이로그를 만들어 보거나 셰프는 새로운 레스토랑이나 음식 트렌드를 검토해 볼 수 있습니다.
새 콘텐츠를 패키징하는 방법을 살펴보세요. 패키징에는 제목과 썸네일이 포함됩니다. 나를 모를 수 있는 새로운 시청자에게 다가가기 위해 디자인을 어떻게 변경할지도 생각해 보세요.
신규 시청자는 선택한 기간 동안 내 채널에서 처음으로 동영상을 시청한 시청자입니다. 다음 사항에 유의하세요.
재방문 시청자보다 신규 시청자가 더 많다면 시청자는 채널 전체의 주제보다 특정 주제나 동영상에 더 관심을 가지고 있을 수 있습니다. 충성도 높은 시청자가 많지 않을 수는 있지만, 더 광범위한 시청자층과 더 많은 시청자에게 다가갈 기회가 더 많이 있습니다.
새 시청률은 '방법 안내' 채널을 통해 확인할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 시청자가 특정 질문에 답하는 동영상을 시청하는 채널이 여기에 해당합니다. 시청자는 답변을 받은 후에 다시 방문하지 않을 수도 있습니다.
더 충성도 높은 시청자층을 구축하는 방법에 대해 생각해 보세요.
주제 또는 형식이 더 일관된 콘텐츠를 만들어 보세요.
이미 시청자에게 인기 있는 것으로 검증된 주제의 동영상 시리즈를 만듭니다.
댓글에 답글 달기 등 커뮤니티와 더 많이 소통하는 방법을 생각해 봅니다.
마지막으로 신규 시청자 및 재방문 시청자 수가 동일하게 유지되는 경우도 있습니다. 이러한 조합은 새로운 시청자를 확보하는 동시에 참여도를 유지하는 데 효과적일 수 있습니다.
조합이 균일했던 기간에 제작한 콘텐츠 유형에 주의를 기울입니다. 채널에서 효과를 보였던 방법과 이를 지속할 방법을 생각해 보세요.
순 시청자 수
순 시청자 수 데이터를 활용하면 시청자 규모를 더 명확하게 파악할 수 있습니다. 시청자 데이터는 지정된 기간에 내 동영상을 시청하기 위해 방문한 시청자 수를 추정하는 목적으로도 사용할 수 있습니다. 한 사람이 컴퓨터와 휴대기기를 번갈아 사용하거나 여러 번 시청하더라도 순 시청자 한 명으로 집계됩니다.
다음은 순 시청자 수 데이터를 활용할 수 있는 몇 가지 방법입니다.
순 시청자 수를 구독자 수와 비교하면 구독자 이외의 더 많은 시청자층에 다가가는 데 도움이 된 동영상을 확인할 수 있습니다.
동영상에서 새로운 시청자의 관심을 끌었던 부분을 파악합니다. 이 정보는 동영상을 게시하기 전과 후의 채널 순 시청자 수를 비교하여 확인할 수 있습니다.
구독자 수가 순 시청자 수보다 많은 경우:
걱정하지 마세요. 크리에이터 대부분의 채널에서 발견되는 추세입니다. 구독자는 다음과 같은 이유로 시간이 지남에 따라 활동이 줄어들 수 있습니다.
동영상을 가끔만 시청함
더 이상 내 채널을 확인하지 않음
더 이상 YouTube에 로그인하지 않음
그래도 조치를 취하려면 다음 안내를 따르세요.
시청자에게 채널 알림을 사용 설정하도록 안내합니다.
더 짧은 기간을 분석한 내용을 보고 있을 수 있습니다. 시간 범위를 확장하여 새로 업로드하면 시청자가 다시 방문하여 순 시청자 수가 증가할 수 있습니다.
신규 시청자를 확보하기 위한 아이디어를 생각해 보세요.
다른 크리에이터와 공동작업을 해보세요.
트렌드 및 시즌 이벤트에 관한 콘텐츠를 제작해 보세요.
썸네일과 제목을 최대한 활용하여 검색 가능성을 높이세요. 업로드 및 재생목록을 통해 항상 채널을 업데이트하세요.
구독자 수
재방문 시청자가 구독자 수보다 적은 이유는 무엇인가요?
구독자 수는 내 YouTube 채널을 팔로우하기 위해 구독한 시청자의 수를 나타내며 내 동영상을 본 시청자의 수를 나타내지는 않습니다. 시청자는 보통 수십 개의 채널을 구독하며 구독 중인 채널에 업로드되는 새 동영상을 모두 시청하는 것은 아닙니다.
YouTube의 추천 시스템은 재방문 시청자에 맞춰 최적화되나요?
추천 시스템은 시청자가 즐길 가능성이 높은 동영상과 채널을 추가로 제안하는 데 목적이 있습니다. 시청자가 다른 동영상 시청을 위해 정기적으로 채널을 재방문하면 추후 내 채널의 동영상이 추천될 가능성이 더 높아집니다.
구독자의 동영상 시청 시간은 구독자가 아닌 사용자의 2배에 이릅니다. 비구독자와 비교하여 구독자가 좋아하고 시청하는 콘텐츠를 살펴봅니다. 이 정보를 통해 구독자가 장기적인 팬이 되도록 유도하는 방법을 생각해 볼 수 있습니다.

Promotions on YouTube let you set up ad campaigns for your content. On top of regular channel growth and organic discovery, promotions can get your videos and shorts in front of new audiences, helping you and your business reach your goals. Let's walk through what promotions are, who might use them, and how to use them. First, what are promotions on YouTube? Promotions let you run your video or short as an ad on YouTube. Your ad can appear in YouTube search results, the home feed, the shorts feed, watch next, or as an ad on other videos on the watch page. Based on goals and criteria you select, YouTube will automatically show your promoted content to viewers who are likely to engage with your channel. Content you promote will be labeled as sponsored. Who might use promotions? Any creator can use promotions. You don't need to be part of the YouTube Partner Program to use them. However, you should have a clear goal in mind when using them.
 Creators use promotions to grow their business or to help get their content in front of new audiences. Promotions can help increase sales by driving additional views to your content that showcases your products or services. Direct viewers to a specific site to buy your merch, products, concert tickets, courses, or more. Or reach a specific audience, like viewers in a new country. Remember, promotions should be used in addition to your channel's organic reach and discovery on YouTube. Also note that any subscribers or watch time gained from promotions spending won't count towards YouTube Partner Program eligibility. Next, how do you use promotions? You can easily set up a promotion for your content from your phone or a desktop. You can do this using the Promote button from your content's watch page. or from your content list by tapping the three-dot menu, then Promote. From Desktop, you can also go to YouTube Studio, then Content, then Promotions, then New Promotion.
 You'll be asked to link your Google Ads account or set up a new one to use promotions. You'll see four main steps when setting up a promotion Goal, Video, Targeting, and Budget. At the Goal step, you'll see the option for audience growth, video views, or website clicks. At the video step, you can add or change the content you want to promote and edit the promotion headline or description. If you chose Website clicks as your goal, you'll also see the option to enter the landing page where you want to send viewers. At the targeting step, you can choose the locations of the viewers you want to reach. And at the budget step, you can choose the budget amount and duration for your promotion. Keep in mind that to be eligible for a promotion, your content must be public or unlisted and at least 10 seconds long. It also needs to meet Google's video ad requirements and Google's editorial advertising policy. Once your promotion is approved and running, you can keep track of metrics like impressions, views, and subscribers.
 You can also make edits while it's running. Finally, let's walk through some questions you may have about promotions. Do I need to promote my content to become a successful channel? Absolutely not. We want to give creators more options to reach new audiences and share their businesses, so we are offering this as an additional lever to help meet your goals. Creators of all sizes can be successful relying on our organic recommendations and a strong content strategy to grow their channel at no cost. Promoting your content is handled separately from our organic systems. Channels and creators can thrive with or without promoting their content. If you do choose to use promotions, there's never any minimum spend and you can stop at any time. What are the best practices for running a promotion and getting the best performance? We recommend running your promotion for at least a week, and keep in mind the targeting choices you make will impact the cost per action for your promotion.
 For example, views in a certain country may cost less than in another country, so make sure you're intentional with your targeting, and you select the options that are important and relevant to your channel. Do promotions hurt the organic reach of my channel or my other videos' performance? No, promotions don't impact the organic performance of your channel or of the promoted content. It's true that promoted content will generally see a drop in aggregated metrics, like audience retention and click-through rate in YouTube Analytics, which is any time there is an increase in reach, whether through promotions or organically. That said, promotions will not impact the way your content is recommended in typical search and discovery on YouTube. Organic recommendations focus on learning how content performs when it is recommended, not when it's run as an ad promotion. To take a closer look, you can always use YouTube Analytics to split out audience retention by organic and paid traffic. Are the subscribers from promotions real?
 Yes! We only count organic subscribers towards YouTube Partner Program eligibility to help keep an equal playing field for everyone interested in joining the program. But subscribers gained from promotions are still subscribers. They can receive notifications about your new content, and they can become robust members of your community. A promotion may kickstart a viewer's relationship with your channel. And if you continue to provide content that's interesting and valuable to them, there are plenty of ways for them to engage once they're aware of you. Right from YouTube, it's simple to use promotions to meet your business and growth goals. If promotions are the right fit for you, try them out. And thanks for watching.

There is a member on my channel that will gift 20 to 50 memberships almost every single live stream.  and I stream twice a week, so it ends up being upwards of 100 memberships a month.  i'm emily d.  baker.  i am a legal commentator and lawyer.  i live stream on YouTube.  i host The Emily Show podcast.  welcome to The Emily Show, the internet's go-to legal analyst.  i break down the pop culture and criminal cases that everybody's talking about. We are now in session. I started doing channel memberships on my YouTube channel because my community asked me for content that really didn't fit in the content that I live stream. So my son's entire color guard is obsessed with Taylor Swift, as one does. I think any creator that wants to connect with their community, which should be all creators, would benefit from channel memberships. But it's great seeing how long you guys have been members for. It's so much fun. You don't have to have a ton of subscribers to have a thriving community on YouTube. I turned on channel memberships when my channel was just over 10,000 subscribers.
 The members-only livestream is the first Thursday of the month. month and sometimes it's a lot of fun as your channel is growing to let your community be there for the ride. Hello amazing members. The thing that I think can overwhelm creators is trying to figure out how to manage all the moving pieces. YouTube bakes in so many great benefits. You just turn them on and you don't have to facilitate anything off platform. Our member loyalty badges are by far the thing my members love the most. And that is a custom icon that I created that goes next to their name. And the way I decided to do it was to change color based on how long they'd been a member. I'm going to have members on my channel that hit the three year, four year and beyond mark. And I can't wait to celebrate with them. It's time for our members only live stream. The member only live chats. I think of it as a tailgate party before my live streams. Good to see you. If you want to chat in the time leading up to a live stream, that's turned on for members only. Same with my premiere videos.
 I also tell stories about my life. Let's have a chat about today. And then the podcast recording starts. is a lot of fun for me. I let the members in as I record my podcast. Full transparency, this is our behind the scenes. They get to see all the outtakes, the retakes. So this is how I feel. And they get to ask questions as I'm finishing recording. Do you worry about running into lawyers that we've been a little critical of? No. And that can really help me not just answer the questions the audience has as I'm recording. And I appreciate the all of the questions, but know that the podcast audience is going to have those questions too. And they get a member shout out as I answer their questions and record that behind the scenes. I'm going to have to start recording. We got to start recording. We have to start. I mean, I'm going to be recording it anyway. Might as well do it with the members. They're basically my content directors and my legal research team. The members are like, girl, what you said was this. And I think what you meant was this. And then I can reshoot. And now we're here. And I love y'all.
 Gifted Memberships is one of the coolest, things I've ever seen. Brandy, thank you for the gifted memberships. And those memberships are distributed to people that are in the chat. And then they get a full month of access to everything I have in the member spaces. I realized I was getting asked quite a lot. How do I turn on channel memberships? I now have a set blurb about how to turn on channel memberships so that people can receive them as gifts. And it's really a great trial period for people to get to experience what it's like as a member. Channel members have a lot of impact on the content that I create. So all of you that are excited for this topic, go thank the members. I regularly ask them, do you want me to cover this or that? And it's so nice knowing that those are the most invested viewers on my channel that they get to sway the direction of the content that I cover. Y'all talk amongst yourselves.
And knowing that your videos are going to perform because your core community had a part in creating it takes a lot of pressure off as a creator. Amazing law nerds. What I love about having the ability to make videos just for your members, if you want to experiment with potentially shifting your core content, you actually have now an incubator and that gives you incredible freedom as a creator to grow and to change and to experiment. Because most of us started creating videos because we had something to say and wanted to share. - Law nerds, we are called to order. - And if you keep doing that for a certain amount of years, those things are gonna grow and change. I want all of the creators to turn on channel memberships. I think they'd be happier creators if they did. We're here and I love it the most. When creators are happy and communities are happy, it makes a platform a really fun place to be. Hit record on that and then we'll hit record on this and then we'll just jump right in.

And I felt like if you can buy a latte once a month, you can join channel memberships. I cannot wait to share it with you. I create food content on my main channel. So when I am creating that sweet potato casserole that I hope to serve at my Thanksgiving table, here's a bite. At the end of that video, I may say, hope you've enjoyed spending time with me, enjoy this casserole, but if you wanna watch how my Thanksgiving table comes together, come hang out with us on membership. I have a membership video all about the process. It just gives it a very organic feel. For memberships, I offer three tiers. So for tier one, you get custom badges and custom emojis to use all throughout my content, which makes it really easy for me to find you. If you have a question on every video, and it's easy for me to comment back almost immediately. And then for tier two, you're going to get additional video content. And now I'm going to show you what the studio is like. I think of them as like a video diary. to the chef.
 Some of my favorite videos that I've shared on memberships have been videos in Italy with my family. It's been content with my nonna. She cooks all day every day. It's just a really great way for me to invite those core members into my home and be part of this group. Crazy fun that we have. I am fancy. Hash darn it, I will say, Boss on Then we have tier three. We also offer live hangouts. The members only livestream is what I call my sip and chat. Let's sip and chat, which is exactly what it sounds like. we sip a cocktail and we chat about anything that could be coming up food-wise, holiday. I'm very excited. It's also a really great way for me to get feedback that I can use in creating the content that I use on my main channel. Thank you for allowing me to be myself. I think when creating membership videos, a piece of advice I would give is to ask yourself, what is the most valuable to your audience?

Creating members only content is an easy, effective way to offer great perks for your members. With channel memberships, you can offer members only videos, shorts, live streams, and posts. Fans consistently tell us that members only content is their favorite part of memberships and lets you experiment with more lightweight, casual content like Q&As, behind the scenes looks, clips of upcoming videos, and more. So let's walk through the different ways you can create and share members-only content with your fans. First, members-only videos. If you create a dedicated video just for members, you can set it as members-only during the upload flow. To do this, go to visibility, then select members-only. You can also choose to set an existing video as members-only. Members with notifications enabled will receive notifications for your members only videos. Your members will also find members only videos on the videos tab and memberships tab.
These videos will also surface on their subscriptions feed and may surface on your members YouTube homepage and more. next, members only shorts.  members only shorts are a great way to provide regular, lightweight content for your members, like sneak peeks, early access announcements, short Q&As, and more.  members Only Shorts are only discoverable by members, so you can experiment with shorts that are more casual and organic compared to your public content. You can designate a short as members only during the upload flow by going to visibility then selecting members only. You can also choose to set an existing short as members only. Your members will see your members only shorts in their shorts feed and subscription feed and from your channel on the shorts tab and the memberships tab. They may also surface on your members YouTube homepage and more. Like regular shorts, members only shorts will not trigger a notification. But consider creating a members only post host, and attach the members only short.
 this would send a notification to eligible members.  note that Members Only Shorts must be fully original content, and can't include music owned by third parties, including music from the Shorts Music Library. videos and shorts you can also schedule your content to go from members only to public this option gives your channel members special early access to new videos or shorts first before they get their public release you can set this up during the upload flow under visibility then schedule Here, choose from members only to public. You can then choose a day and time for when you want it to go from members only to publicly available. Using this option helps you utilize your pre-planned content and gives your members special early access, which can be especially beneficial for them if your content features a special announcement, product drop, or limited time deal. next, members only livestreams.  members only livestreams lets you stream exclusively to your members.
you can do this from your computer or your phone.  from a computer, sign in to YouTube Studio and click Create.  then, go live and follow the steps to create a live stream. In the visibility settings, select members only and which membership level can view your stream. To set up a members only stream from your phone, tap the create icon, then swipe to live. Go to the visibility settings and select members only. then choose which membership level can view your stream. Head back to the stream details page where you can tap next then go live. Members with notifications enabled will receive notifications for your members only stream. one 30 minutes before the scheduled start time and one once your members only stream starts. Your members will also find ongoing members only streams on your channel homepage, the live tab and memberships tab. These streams will also surface at the top of their subscriptions feed and may surface on your members YouTube homepage and more. Finally, members only posts.
 You can use the community tab to share specific posts with just your members. When creating a community post from your phone or computer, select the visibility drop-down and select which members you want to post to. You can use posts to show them special content, share a never-before-seen photo or announcement, poll them, or thank them for supporting your channel and more. You can also use them to promote your members-only videos, shorts, or streams. Eligible members can receive notifications for your members-only posts, and your members can find these posts in the community tab. Be sure to promote your members-only content even to your broader audience. Members at the right level can immediately watch your members-only content, and for no non-members, a note will show letting them know it's members only and they can sign up to watch, which might help to encourage more memberships. So consider sharing members only content to your wider audience from a post, card, or playlist. You can also add a dedicated members only section to your channel homepage.
 To do this, go to YouTube Studio, then customization.  under featured sections, select Add Section, then select the option for members only content.  members only content is one of the highest valued perks for memberships, so try it out.  for more info, check out the links below.  thanks for watching.

 So every time we put something out, we look at how it's doing. Personally, I'll go in there and I'll see in terms of growth, how, how, how is it growing as a video? Again, the retention time, how long are people actually watching this video? And so, but I also, I'm also subscribed to a lot of content creators that actually sort of do research on what the algorithm is doing. And so they'll be in, they'll sort of announce whenever there's an announcement, because I don't know where these announcements happen, but I follow a lot of creators who will say they've, started doing this and they've started doing this and then I'll tell them, I'll say, hey, Mr. Beast says. And then she'll be like, okay, cool, let's do it. Because our goal, like I said, because we do podcasts, it also makes us quite versatile in how we can put out our content.
Because you have an hour, 30 minutes of footage, you can go either way. You can find really catchy hooks, in the content, or you can go in depth with it. And it's just about where the platform is at that point, what's working, what's everyone else doing, and sort of slotting in your content and your perspective to suit that. But yeah, it's about having your ear on the ground and seeing what other creators are doing. How are they... How are they innovating in terms of putting out their content? And when you see that, you look at how it's working and how their page is growing, and then you try and implement that into your own page. For sure, for sure. I think one thing that's super important as a creator is actually watching content. So you can have an idea of what's going on on the platform, you know, so it is very useful that you do look at a lot of content so that you're in the loop with that.
 No, definitely. Yeah, something that I found really interesting in one of our previous conversations, actually, Brendan, was when you said that you watch kind of like US or UK creators to see what trends are coming up. And then obviously, because you guys are based in South Africa, you use those trends to your advantage. You may be sort of like even a year down the line, you can kind of predict what's coming up. So can you tell us a little bit about that research? Because I think other people listening to this podcast would find that so interesting. Yeah. Yeah, so we realized like a few years ago that everything sort of starts in the northern hemisphere and then falls down, especially technologically. So whenever there is beta programs, we don't have access to them. but we know they're there because we are on the platform. So we see it. And so being plugged into what's happening in the UK and in the US, it kind of really helps for us because we can see where everything is moving towards.
 And, and, And a lot of the content creators will share it and they'll say, this is what's happening. This is what we're doing. And so whenever that happens, we then just kind of get ready and prepare ourselves, put ourselves in a position for whenever that feature is unlocked here, we can then take advantage of it. In fact, it's not just in content. It's actually just in everything. Right, it's really interesting how you've been able to turn what some could perceive as a disadvantage, having to wait to get access to features, into an advantage because it gives you foresight. You can see maybe what mistakes others are making and make sure to avoid those, and you can see what things others are doing really well, and you can make a plan of how to implement them into your own plans. You know, even on your channel, Mvumi, you make use of so many of YouTube's features, you know, it would seem that you just had it locked in from the beginning. We're going to make use of memberships. We're going to make use of, you know, joining a partner program. We're going to do all this thing.
 But obviously, as of every creator, it's a gradual thing over time. Could you tell us a bit about the journey of like unlocking features of YouTube and actually using them to their advantage? Yeah. I think it goes back to what Brendan's sharing. Watching other creators that we look up to that inspires us is very interesting. And we're researchers, even though we research in different ways, but we're researchers. And once you get into things, because another thing with a lot of creatives is we get stuck in the research and then we don't implement. And then we're just stuck with a whole lot of information and nothing's happening. So for us…

출처 : 유튜브 [youtube insider]
 in as much as there's a lot of research that goes into what we're doing we are building the plane as we fly it so i'm looking literally i'm literally um putting out these podcasts but then i realize like now the world is changing in that when i have a guest for example a celebrity on my on my podcast there's certain things that i've created such a safe space that a person would share voluntarily. However, the internet is no longer a safe space like that, so there's certain parts of a video where on a different platform it does, it's a safer space. But perhaps putting a longer video on YouTube, people can just screen grab three minutes. So then that's why now we have to look at where can we put exclusive content so that my guests feel safe. And so that next time I invite someone on my podcast, they feel safe to come because their content wasn't just snapped at three minutes without context and then being spread.
 You know, we have to think of things like that. So that's when we jumped into membership. So now on YouTube, we probably have like 10 minutes of a video where we know that our guest is safe, is protected, everything is in context. But in membership, people who are paying get to have the full thing. But I also know that my guest is protected. And also people want that community aspect. I realized during COVID, a lot of us went into shelves and I think a sense of community was lost. And In the beginning with my channel, it was all about my story, my becoming, my purpose, how to do this. And then post lockdown, a year or two in, I realized that my number one need that I'm fulfilling is a need of community. People need a community, a space of belonging, like-minded people together with. And that's what membership offers. It's like like-minded people who come together for the purpose of belonging. learning about wellness.
 So with your audience in Pumi, are most of your audience based in South Africa or are they global? I think my global reach is growing. We have majority is South Africa, but second on the list, I've got Botswana, our neighboring countries. I've got Botswana, I've got Namibia, I've got Zimbabwe and we're starting to have footprint in the UK. I actually realized when I was there that a lot of South Africans moved from South Africa to live in the UK. So there's a huge... South African market in the UK. We're starting to penetrate the US market. So little by little, we're getting footprint all over the world. Yeah, but majority is still in South Africa. Are you guys kind of like planning a strategy to become more global to get more viewers in the US or the UK? Brendan, why are you blushing?
 No, because I don't think we're planning a strategy, but I think the world generally now is so much smaller because of social media. So Like Mpumi said, there's a lot of diaspora in every country. So everyone wants to feel that they belong and they want to get in touch with where they're from. And so that's a great way to enter every country's market is through people who actually are championing you. And I find that a lot of, like Mpumi said, a lot of the girls that move from here to the UK and it's obviously a culture shock. their best friend would be Mbumi and Mbumi's podcast. That's how they keep to the ground and how they remember who they are and what they relate to best. And then they share it with a friend. And then that friend shares with their husband and then the husband's like, oh, she's got a husband. Her husband is a cool guy.

When did you first realize you had a reach beyond just YouTube? Nigeria or beyond just the UK, the US. When did you realize you had an international audience?
 I think at the beginning when I realized it was my audience was kind of like i had more because i used to look at the analytics i realized oh i had a lot of people from the us from the uk watching for me it was just more like okay when i saw that i was like if they if they are interested in watching what i'm making now that means if i traveled there they would also probably be interested in watching it so um i i would say that it was Meeting people, seeing them when I travel, that made me decide to go there. Because I've always wanted to have an international audience. I've always wanted to make videos that anybody that goes to the world can watch. Because I thought about the fact that all the people I was learning how to make videos from, like the KC Nightclub, I've never met them before. but I'm watching their videos and I'm in Lagos, Nigeria. So that means I can also make my own videos wherever I am in the world and anybody across the world can also watch it.
 So the whole point of like expanding and traveling out there has always been something that I've always wanted to do. And secondly, when I started to understand analytics and CPM, I realized that the international audience, the CPM and you know, CPM is cost per meal is how much you make by 1000 views for a lot of people who are watching. I realized that, um, If you have an international audience, you make more money. So I started to kind of like pivot my content recently from last year, like within last year and this year now to appeal more to like the international audience. So, yeah. Right. What I'm just curious, like on that note, what sort of strategies are you employing to nurture that international audience more or what are you thinking of using anyway?
 Yeah, so one of the things I've realized and I've started doing is just one it's like okay who do I want to appeal to and what are they interested in and you know kind of like having like my audience profile like what does that what does my audience look like my major audience I realize my major audience like the people who watch me the most are people in my age group who are interested in traveling the world and seeing places and And if I think about it, when I think about it, I'm like, okay, checking my traffic, where is most of my audience coming from? What are the sorts of content that would appeal to them? Also, another one is also looking at a lot of like the YouTubers in America, like, okay, where are they going to? How can I make this video that they made, but in my own way?
 how can I share my own perspective even though I'm an African discovering the world but you know maybe a lot of like guys in Canada or guys in the US have made videos about a specific country I can go there and also make my own video and share my own you know like perspective because the fact that a lot of people watch that video from America that means if I make my own they'll probably see it too so those are some of the strategies I think one I also did recently with the Caribbean was like I realized that most of the people who travel to the Caribbean yeah mostly from America So that was why I went there to make videos like the Bahamas video. I also wanted to visit Bahamas though, but the main idea behind it was like, okay, to get more of that international audience. And eventually like looking at the analytics after dropping the video, I realized that like, Over 40 something percent of people watch that video. They are all from America. It sounds like you've taken a lot of inspiration from other YouTubers, other creators internationally. And I know that you've also collaborated with them.
 I'd love to hear your thoughts on general collaboration. Have you found that it's helped you build your audience? Has it helped the people you've collaborated with to build their audience? So, yeah, well... It's very complicated because sometimes I've collaborated with, you know, when I was starting out, I used to feel like if you just had a collaboration with like one big YouTuber, you know, you just blow up and then you just have all these subscribers. But gradually, as I've gotten to do it over time, I realized that sometimes, you know, it doesn't really do much. And collaborations, collaboration is good.
 depending on who you decide to pick and depending on how it is done because i've done collaborations with people before and how it was done it wasn't done in a way where it's like kind of like mutual so you have to figure out who the person is what kind of content it is you know does it does it align with the person's audience because imagine me i'm a travel i'm a travel channel and i'm doing if i did a collaboration with debbie a cooking channel so if travel and cooking is still kind of like related but it's like it has to be kind of like similar or maybe like a business channel now and I'm travel if it's if it's too far apart or a gaming channel imagine like I'm a travel creator and I did a collaboration on the gaming channel it won't it won't really it won't work we find a way to make it work don't worry we find a way but yeah it's in this chat I definitely understand what you mean. It's super important that the audience that you're trying to mesh are audiences that share similar interests.
That's definitely something I, a misconception I had when I was younger was all you need is one big shout out or one big collaboration and then every person in that audience will come to you. And then when you think about it, it's like, wait a minute, when the creators I've watched have done a video of someone else, the only time I've gone to check out that person's channel is when that person had content I was interested in, because I'm interested in the creator I'm already watching. And so I think that's something that's really important. for creators to consider is that, wait a minute, is there an audience synergy here? Is there something that this creator can offer my audience? Not just me as a creator, but can they offer something to my audience? Because that's how they're going to grow. So absolutely, I think that's a terrific point to bring up. Yeah, definitely. I think audience is so important. Like, obviously, we focus a lot on creating the content and it can get kind of swept up in you, your videos, you put it out there.

But how do you interact with your audience? I'm interested to know that.
Do you specifically reply to comments or, I don't know, give us a little insight into your community? Yeah, so for my audience, I think when I started out and even up to now, one of the things I try to do is to reply to as many comments as possible. So if I drop a new video, I reply to a lot of comments. Even my last video I dropped yesterday, I think I've replied to probably maybe like 10, 20 comments now. And I'm still going to go back again and reply to it. I think that's one of the best ways to interact because it's like, like, for somebody to take out time out of their day to watch your video and comment. There's usually some people who even have like five, six, seven lines of comments. Like, it means they took time to type that thing out. And then if you don't respond or if you don't reply or they see that you don't reply, it's not, you know, you can't, you're not engaging. That means you're not engaging with your audience. And then, For me, an engaged audience is very important. I always like to feel like we are in conversations because from there you can even get feedback or ideas for your videos.
 So I use my comments, I use my community tab. I posted a video two days ago, the video got demonetized, so I had to take it down and I had to go to my community tab to tell them that, oh, okay, this is what happened because some people were watching the video when it got taken down. So community tab is also one I use. Comment, the comment, I also use the comment. And another one I started doing last year was if I go to a country, I try to do meetups because there's nothing... I did a meetup in London, I did a meetup in New York, and it was interesting actually seeing the people who watch you physically. I think about 50 people came, so 50 people, they are people who watch me. So interacting with them in real life was very interesting for me, because for me, community is everything. Community is the most important reason why we still even exist on this platform, because if there was no community, you just post videos and nobody watches.
So I believe interacting and keeping that community interaction healthy is very key. When you realize these people behind the usernames are real people, it's such a weird feeling. It's crazy. But Simi, have you ever been to a convention or anything? Have you ever met any of your viewers? I did have that happen to me. in Germany I went to a gaming convention Gamescom and uh Gamescom there are loads of stalls to like buy all sorts of trinkets and I was on a last minute dash to get something for my family before I came back home and they're like hey what you went abroad you didn't get us anything so I was on a last minute dash um and there was someone that was walking up towards me and I was like is why are they coming towards me I wasn't I wasn't sure what was going on they were like hey uh Tamago, are you a YouTuber? I was like, No way, did I just get recognized in a whole other country. So, you know, it's something which is quite astounding to realize, well, people all over the world are watching.
 I mean, you don't even have to get recognized in person to realize it. Just looking at your YouTube studio analytics and seeing what countries people are watching from, these are real analytics. You can see people watching from all these countries. And it can be really heartwarming. And especially when you have that kind of like, support all over the world. It can bolster you as a creator. It can give you that drive to continue and also give you a sense of confidence in what you're doing that you know that there are people who are watching it. So, Ty, I know that you've been able to leverage the support of your audience in many ways throughout the years.

 If I upload like a weekly blog, I'll upload the intro or the house tour, I'll cut it down and make it into a short. Do you do that as well? Or do you kind of see shorts and long form different? We definitely do more actually now because even just now we posted a video and we did like a short switch, which was like a standalone short, but it came from like the long video like you said at the start, the intro. So I feel like we have got that blend a little bit more now. And I feel like with the tools that YouTube have, being able to add a related video to a short so people see it above your title and they can click through. And sometimes we do do like a call to action at the end where we're like, head to the full video if you want to see Ryan burst into tears over this or that. I feel like that's sort of how we're using shorts to kind of blend it into the long form. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. That related video link as well, that's been so handy. I use that a lot. Yeah, because then you can obviously find new viewers through the shorts. They click on the link and hopefully they'll become a long-term viewer. It's such a handy feature. Definitely, you can see it in the analytics as well.
 I do find it really interesting that you mentioned trying to strike a better work-life balance. There is the idea of having a treadmill that you're on when you're making videos. And I suppose the ability to remix longer form content into shorts does help you to still feel like you're putting something out there that can help you get discovered without having to create something brand new. I actually even did it last night, I took one of my past live streams and I was on the app on my phone. I was like, okay, you can actually restructure the format of the video so you can have like your face cam up at top, the screen at the bottom.

출처 : 유튜브 [youtube insider]
 so youtube shorts is amazing for that because it really does a great job at pushing your content out to an audience who may not be aware of you and for me how it often works is if someone finds one of my shorts they'll often look at the rest of my content and then hopefully I can get them in with one of my longer videos and that's when I can like really hook them in. I know you talk about like evergreen content a lot as well that was the first time I'd actually heard that term. Oh really? Yeah so that's interesting that you make your content to last forever anyone can click on it at any time it's still relevant I guess that's that differs to my content as well because mine is more week by week this is relevant this week now we move on to the next week. Yeah that's so interesting because I And I guess with you, when you're looking at your view count and stuff, you can kind of tell the performance of a video within like weeks of it going live, because it's not necessarily going to pick up later. Whereas mine, like certain topics, when I talk about podcasting, I know that won't pick up straight away. But I know in six months time, it will have its moment. Like it's always with certain things. It's so interesting, isn't it? Yeah. I think they call it the long tail where it drops off, but it doesn't quite hit zero. And that tail actually makes up more than... that initial burst. Yeah yeah no stuff like that is always really cool and you're mentioning just earlier about you know Hannah she would have a very dedicated audience to her viewers because they're here to see you right

Community posts give creators an easy, lightweight way to engage with their audience through polls, quizzes, text, and more. They show on your channel's community tab, the YouTube homepage, and the subscriptions feed, and can help you deepen your connection with your existing audience and communities outside of your usual uploads. Let's walk through eligibility requirements, how to create and manage community posts, and some best practices. First, who's eligible for community posts? There's no subscriber requirement to post. In the YouTube app, tap the Create icon to see if you have access to post. Next, how can you create a community post? There are a couple entry points that you can use to create a post. From the YouTube app, you can tap the Create icon, then Post. You can also get started from YouTube Studio using the Create buttons, or by going to your channel and then the Community tab on desktop or mobile.
 From here, you can share a text update, add an image, create an image or text poll, quiz your audience, and more. You can post right away or schedule your post, and you can set your post to expire after 24 hours. You can also choose your post's audience setting. If you're a creator who has channel memberships, you can create a post just for your channel members. This allows you to show them exclusive content and thank them for supporting your channel. Next, what are some best practices and ideas for using posts on YouTube? Consider using posts regularly to complement your video uploads and start authentic conversations. And be sure to build engagement and excitement by interacting in the comments and with follow-up posts. And consider trying out these post ideas. Start a conversation with a fellow creator or give a shout out to a fan using their handle. Give a quick update to your audience with an image post or using a text post. Poll your audience on what type of video they want to see next.
 You can also add images to each poll option by selecting Image Poll. You can also choose to set a poll to expire after 24 hours. Quiz your audience with a multiple-choice question and then share how many got it right. Tease an upcoming special announcement or video with a GIF of its best moment. Show off special behind-the-scenes photos. You can also add filters, stickers, and text. And share info about upcoming events, collabs, or even products that you want to share.

To edit the placement, use the Preview video player to drag and drop the element. The preview window will show you how the elements will show against your video, so you can check and ensure nothing is interfering with important visuals in your video. You can also click the grid icon to decide if you want the preview player to show a grid over the video preview, snap to grid, and snap to element for help with placing your elements. If you change your mind about what you added, you can use undo, redo, or the trash icon to make edits or delete the element. Once you're done adding and editing your end screen elements, click save.
Note you can also add end screens to an existing video by going to YouTube Studio, then Content. Once you select the video you want to edit, on the video details page you'll see the end screen option. Keep in mind that your video has to be at least 25 seconds long to use end screens. End screens aren't available for videos set as made for kids, and they aren't available on mobile web or in the YouTube Music app. You can check the performance of your end screens by going to YouTube Analytics, then advanced mode.  click more, then select the report for End Screen Element or end screen element type.  for more info, check out the links in the description.  thanks for watching!
